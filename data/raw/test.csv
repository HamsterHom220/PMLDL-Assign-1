"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack",0/0,3.0,These batteries have been used in various household applications and everything seems to be working strong even after a couple of months. Panasonic isn't a brand I use often but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did.,5667
Fisher-Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile,0/0,5.0,"My son LOVES this mobile. He'll lay in his crib and coo at this mobile for 10-15 minutes no problem. It's been very useful for when I have to quickly make and eat lunch while I'm home alone.The leaves that open and close mesmerize my son and he seems to love the brightly-colored rainforest creatures. The base unit also plays pleasant classical music and has a nice, warm nightlight (both of which don't seem to do anything for my guy, though). Putting together the mobile wasn't too difficult either, considering that I managed to do it all by myself WHILE carrying my son in a front-load baby carrier. The base wouldn't screw onto the front or back of my baby's crib (Europa baby Geneva crib), but it's been fine on the side rail, closer to the backside of the crib.",28
Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Wet/Dry Straightening Iron,0/0,4.0,Wonderful to work with. Great for all hair types as it will adjust to your desired level of heat. Non damaging and effective. I ordered for a cousin and she loves it. I have been using it for over a year now. Grab it while it's available as other stores seem to have let it go from their inventory. It probably kept their competitors from selling! Love it.,5993

Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,4.0,"I got one of these for each of my dogs. They work but the dogs still fight it everytime I put it on them. One even rubbed the skin off her nose trying to get it off. BUT, it does calm them down and makes them walk nicely (when they're not fighting it). Probably just need more individual work before trying to walk them both together. I'd buy them again.",1145
"KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Peanut Butter",0/0,5.0,I got my dog the large Kong toy for christmas. These fit inside perfect and she has a good old time trying to get it out. I have never had a complaint about a Kong product. I will definitely be getting a refill of these,6217
"Merkur ""Futur"" Safety Razor, Satin Finish",0/1,1.0,"I recently purchased the Merkur Satin Finish Safety Razor. It is difficult to shave with as soon as the handle gets wet with water or soap. I have to constantly correct its position. Also, the handle feels very short in my grip which adds to this problem. If the handle were about an inch longeror even more and knurled somewhat, the task of shaving would be far more enjoyable. In the end, I will not recommend such an expensive razor to my friends unless these problems (in my view) are corrected.",1194

Glytone Glytone Retexturize Body Lotion,0/0,3.0,"I should have followed my instincts on this after reading the reviews of the other Glytone lotion, ""Glytone Body Lotion, 8.4-Ounce Package,"" where folks had issues with the pump breaking. Well, mine broke right off the bat out of the box, after I tried to use it for the first time, tonight. Still anxious to give the actual product a chance, I unscrewed the pump base and pulled some of the lotion out to rub on, but found that the creamy texture is an awful sticky petroleum based lotion - I feel like a lubed ball joint. I admit that I don't have KP, and I was only seeking the preventative benefits of this lotion, but I think I'm better off ""sticking"" to my coconut oil. This product should certainly be only used at bedtime. If you use it before getting dressed for the day, you may never get your clothes to fit right. If I get a rash, this product is going right back to Amazon. I'm holding out hope for the SPF version - I'll try that, tomorrow, but will allow plenty of time, just in case I need to jump back into the shower.",3922

Ambajam Mini Cuddle-Up Baby Blanket,0/0,5.0,The first one of these we got as a gift. I didnt push it on my daughter as her lovey; she just naturally took to it herself. She loves to rub it against her face while falling asleep. Since then I bought a second one to share the wear and tear with the first one. I also feel they are pretty expensive but hey what can ya do??,7910
Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey,0/0,5.0,"I have used ON products in the past and have always been satisfied. I stopped using their protein for a little while ($) and the other protein that I used just wasn't the same.This is my first time trying the Natural Whey and I am going to stick with it. The taste is tolerable when used alone but I usually mix with fruit, or a green drink powder.Oh and I get monthly blood work and my protein levels are higher with this(7.3) then the other protein that I used (6.7).",2981
Multi Voice Changer by Toysmith,0/0,2.0,"My daughter HAD to have this toy....so Santa did her due diligence and checked reviews online, found a good price on Amazon and secured this silly toy. It doesn't work that well. The voices all sound about the same and you have to speak directly into it for it to work at all. My daughter hasn't picked it up much since Christmas. Parents? I'd leave it. There has to be something comparable out there that actually works. Great idea, terrible execution. Pass this one.",9580
Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer,0/2,1.0,"I bought this product based on the good reviews. However, it just died after only 3 months of infrequent use. I changed the batteries and it didn't work, it's dead. What a waste of money. It also didn't trim completely bare, however it was better than a manual razor as I didn't get those awful red bumps afterwards. But the attachment doesn't even work, I had to take it off whenever I used it as otherwise it didn't get any hairs, and then it would just scratch my skin while it shaved. Avoid!",8415
"Petmate Hooded Litter Pan Set Large, Black/Gray",0/0,5.0,"I have 7 adult cats (Persians) and I think this is a great litter box. The high sides helps to keep the litter in the litter box if you own a cat that is really enthusiastic about digging. I have found no problem with the top not adhering to the bottom of the litter box, although I would NEVER carry a litter box by its handle as with the litter in the litter box this makes the litter box way too heavy to depend on a handle. I do NOT snap the top onto the bottom of the litter box with the tabs as I like easy access to the box. Much easier to pop off the top, scoop and then return the top to the litter box without latching the side tabs. The top sits fine on the bottom without the snap latches and do not fall off when a cat enters or exits the box. This litter box works well with kittens and with adults up to about 15 pounds. Any cat larger than that would need a larger sized litter box. I have used these litter boxes for over 5 years now and I highly recommend it to those cat owners of cats 15 pounds or less.",510
"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,5.0,This is an easy way to provide a calming solution to cats that may be a bit anxious.My vet uses this in her office and I have been using it at home. Less accidents with litter boxes .I returned to work full time so my cats are a bit more anxious. This item is very expensive at local pet shops,2491
Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,4.0,"I needed a dog bed that my girls would not destroy. They tend to unstuff all of the pillow type beds I buy for them. My only problem is that I bought the large size because they like to sleep together and I wanted them to have plenty of room, but the bed is too big for the area I had intended to put it. I thought about exchanging for a smaller size, but they really seem to like it, so I am going to keep it for basement or outdoor use and purchase another one in a smaller size for them to use in the house. I have two 13&#34; beagles, so they will still have plenty of room to snuggle up on the medium or small size.",4719
Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,4/4,5.0,"I just wanted to write in since I noticed that some of the reviews mentioned they received one large amount that needed to be measured into 6 separate applications. I'm pleased to report that I received 6 separate pre-measured applications. The seller was actually Amazon so maybe that made the difference. Hope this helps others. Buy when the seller is actually Amazon and you should get 6 separate applicators.I've been using Frontline for about 7 months now and have been very happy with the product. No fleas, no ticks, no problems.",293

Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),1/1,5.0,This is a review for Beetlejuice Blu-Ray. The video transfer from Warner Bros. is pretty good given the films 25 yr pedigree. On my disc you must manually select the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless auidio track; it defaults to the Lossy DD 5.1.The Orig. 1.85:1 is slightly stretched to properly fill a 16:9 screen. Danny Elfman's musical score is showing its age as it is not as crisp as a typical new movie. Although it is noticebly better than the DVD audio track.It was a must have to fill my ever growing Blu-ray collection!,1147
Olivella Moisturizer Body Lotions,0/0,5.0,"I needed a moisturizer, i always bought lotion , this time i decided to buy this very satisfied overall great product.Reduces redness in skin, great moisturizer for dry skin.Really recommend to others!",4441
"Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, Fresh Scent, 14-Pounds",0/0,5.0,"My house is a mult-cat household and I don't want it smelling like a cat box. With the Super Scoop I and my guests can enjoy my cats without smelling the box.While all clumping litters clump, some better than others, not all are suitable for use in an automatic, self-cleaning litter box. The Super Scoop excells at this. It clumps firmly and stays hard so the automatic box can do its work. It also absorbs nearly all of the odor so the cat box can been seen before it can be smelt. I've used this product in a prior LitterMaid unit and now in myPetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box. The Super Scoop has worked flawlessly in those applications.When I adopted a new cat recently, I set up a seperate little box until she could be accustomed to my house and other pets. It was the low-tech variety needing to be scooped on a regular basis. Once again the Super Scoop made the clumps easy to remove and the cat box itself was nearly odorless.The Arm and Hammer Super Scoop is now my preferred brand.",434
Zen Reflections Juniper Bonsai,0/0,3.0,"Had I seen what I was getting ahead of time I probably would have not purchased this plant. I suppose this is not something you can't mass produce so what you get may or may not fulfill your expectations. My Bonsai was packed with Styrofoam ""peanuts"" which went all over the place when I opened it. Despite the packing there was some damage to the little fisherman and his pole. The plant itself is little more than a single twig bent at an angle and really does not resemble a miniature tree unless you apply a lot of imagination. Judging by the pictures, I gather you may luck out and get a nice looking one so before you order, you have to ask yourself, are you feeling lucky? One other thing, the little ""pond"" does not hold water. There were no instructions on caring for it but my daughter gave me some tips. I mist it several times a day and it seems to be healthy enough, just not that much to look at relative to what I hoped it would be.",870
Infantino Travel Gym,0/0,3.0,"The gym is cute, my daughter loves the toys that come with it - even though the monkey never worked for us.The mirror didn't get interesting 'til she realized she could pull it down and get her mouth on it.... yes, she can pull the whole thing over to get the toys into her mouth.THe single-bar design is much more flimsy than double bar models.We wash it fairly often - so I've gotten good at the set-up... and it's pretty easy to set up. but it just doesn't hold up.I'm also not sold on the extra PUFF to the monkey's head. It makes tummy-time difficult for a little baby who's still learning to hold her head up + forces a lilt to any position as she's older.",1281

African Shea Oil - 8 ozs.,0/0,5.0,This oil is great for all over the body. Hair and skin can benefit from use. I have only one complaint with this bottle. It is not enough. 8 oz is way too small for a product such as this one. You can go through it very quickly because it is very light...It is a great product and i plan on purchasing again.,5175

AquaClear Power Filter (UL Listed),0/0,5.0,Been using this filter for a few months now. Much cheaper to keep running than the old filter that I was using and easier to clean. The sponge will last much longer than they say it will and the carbon will too. Very pleased with my purchase.,3040

LE MALE,1/1,2.0,The spray valve arrived off the bottle and is damaged. This will probably prevent me from using what product is left. I would recommend one buy this product from a brick and morar store...not online.,6027
CytoSport Cytomax Sport Energy Drink,0/0,3.0,"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now. Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax. Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax. Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey. For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey. Who knows?I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula. As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.",1614
"Navitas Naturals Organic Mulberries Turkish Superfruit, 16-Ounce Pouch",0/0,1.0,"I absolutely love Navitas mulberries, but they seem to have a problem with quality control. The bag I received was very moist and had many moldy berries. Amazon refunded the purchase price, which I appreciated.",5808

Immobilizer Support Collar,0/1,2.0,"On the one hand, I'm well aware that I get what I pay for. On the other hand, I was fairly certain that the low price on this collar was/is an indication that it didn't have much to offer. Therefore, my bad. I should have (and maybe will ) shell out lots more $$ for a collar that is comfortable enough to wear, even when sleeping.",2337

In fairness, I never got around to contacting the seller, so problem may have been resolved if I had.

Maybe it was just me.",3540

Trix HO Locomotive Wheel Cleaning Brush,0/0,5.0,"These are designed to interlock together so you can clean your larger engines all at once as you note in the diagram one will only cover one set of wheels at a time on standard engines. As another person pointed out do not press down on the engine. What I found works best for me is keep most of th weight off the engine for a few seconds while slowly lowering the engines full weight on the scrubber. You do need to hold the engine as it will power right on off the pads. This is the only way to really clean engine wheels that I know of, the way I did it before was with a wire brush which only gets the part of the wheels showing when removed from the track.",5359
Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,This product is amazing. I have been using the gentle leader for over two months and it has changed walks with my dog forever! No longer am I that woman getting pulled along by her 70 pound dog- she walks at my side confident and it makes me a happy dog mom.I will tell you my Weimaraner was a puller and jumper and to have that under control in just a few hours of wearing the collar- it's a life and back saver!,5938
Party Pooper - Fake Poop,0/0,5.0,Bought this to prank a co worker. I've had so much fun passing this item around to various people. Even when they know what it is the shock value is still funny.

Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"This is a gorgeous royal blue. It goes on smooth without streaking. I prefer essie polish to any other brand, I have real nails and others do not last as long w/o chipping. I change my polish once a week, so I don't know how long you could go before ""having"" to change. I just like to change colors. I do know that after a week of wear there is NO sign of chipping at all. The shine on this is superb, no top coat needed. I would like to thank the seller (HOUSE OF ACCESSORY) for wonderful service! Item arrived on time and packaged so there was no chance of damage during shipment. I have had VERY BAD service from (NAIL DISCOUNT) I was not at all pleased with them! Just a tip...beware who you buy from!",2045

Bvlgari BLV Pour Homme Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,I have bought this fragrance for my husband before and we both really love it. It is a clean masculine scent. The price was excellent! I got double the amount for 50% of the price at regular walk-in stores. Very satisfied!,6454
BareMinerals Eye Shadow,0/0,5.0,"I am in my upper fifties, so bright eye colors are not an attractive option for me! This soft pink is a light color that I use as a neutral shadow that brightens up my upper lids (which tends to disappear with darker & taupe colors.) I use the darker colors (with a light touch) in the crease of my lid. Then I accent my eyes with a little smidgeon of white in both corners of my eyes and a dot in the middle of the lid & blend - it makes my eyes sparkle & the whites look a little brighter. I find that using a subtle shade of eyeliner in teal, deep forest green or charcoal are just the right amount of color to bring out my hazel eyes and looks nice with my silver hair! At this age, less is more - Really!",4981

VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,4.0,"We bought this for my son to play with and also to work on sitting to standing. It does have a lot of great interactive options on the front, and he loves pulling the phone off, flipping the gate open and shut, and playing with the shapes. It is a fun toy for him. But a few drawbacks of the toy - 1. the ""low"" volume is really not very low. 2. There is not really enough of an angle between the legs of the toy so it's hard for him to pull up on it. 3. When on ""music"" mode, each item you touch makes a sound, but if you touch something else, the first sound doesn't stop, and so on. It's hard to learn cause and effect if there are 5 things making noise at the same time and he doesn't know which is which.",8764
Hugo Boss Bottled (No. 6) Men EDT Splash 0.16oz Mini,0/0,3.0,I was disappointed because it was so small. I guess I should have known because it said 0.16. Just can't visualize that size. My own fault.,4644

"ProVersa JWM6CF Wall Mount Hair Dryer with 2-Speed and 3-Heat Settings, 1600-Watts, White Finish",0/0,5.0,"We purchased the first Jerdon wall mount dryer about 10 years ago. I have severe arthritis and like how much power is available in such a small, lightweight, wall mountable unit. It drys my thick, medium length,colored hair very quickly.We liked it so much that we purchased two more as replacements in case Jerdon was no longer manufacturing them when the original one went out (also to avoid putting new holes in the wall). Well, about 6 1/2 years later, the first one stopped working - after warning us with a burning smell. My husband said I should have kept the air intake a bit cleaner. Given how long previous hair dryers have lasted, we were pleased with that life span.We just finished remodeling our master bathroom and no longer want a wall-mountable unit, so it is being installed in the guest bathroom. It can fit in small spaces leaving the bath counter free for our guests. I highly recommend this dryer.",6081

"Life Extension Melatonin 3mg Dissolving Lozenges, 60-Count",0/0,5.0,"I noticed that the tablets don't really work too well for me and most of the other dissoluble ones I've tried leave me a little groggy the next day. This one also dissolves a lot slower than others (not a plus, just an observation). I get sleepy about 1/2 hour after letting it dissolve and sleep all through the night, even wearing a CPAP. Highly recommend - especially if you have tried Melatonin before and it didn't work as you hoped.",2497

My 5 yr old nephew licked his upper lip raw. My sister purchased high dollar creams but it didnt work . I put this shea butter on his chapped raw skin twice and by the next day it was completley healed! I use it as a skin cream and I am thrilled that it tightens the neck skin, reduces puffy eyes and erases fine lines. I swear by this cream and just placed another order. Its lightly scented and a little goes a long way!",8014
"Loops 2 Double Handle Nylon Leash, 6-Foot, Blue",0/0,3.0,This is a nice leash with a sturdy clip. The loop is smaller and lower than expected. It is great for a large dog but for a small or medium sized dog the loop is too low as you have to bend down to get it.,4817

Bare Escentuals BareMinerals,0/0,4.0,I love Bare Minerals makeup. It goes on so smooth you can hardly tell your wearing makeup. Its light and great in the warmer weather. My old makeup form years ago would make me sweat and my makeup run. This is really good makeup and does not do that. The only thing I dont like is the lock lid. It makes the last bit of makeup not come out of the container. I like the older lids Bare Minerals used to have.,1059

I tried a new package of yeast (tested on other bread first) and still no action... I tried it with a slow rise method and nothing. I proofed it in the oven, only to waste more time and energy trying to get this bread to rise, and nothing has worked. Attempting to bake resulted in a flat dead loaf.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, otherwise I am done with Hodgson Mill bread mixes. This was a waste of time, energy and money!",9413
Doc Johnson Anal Plug,0/0,4.0,I assume this product was scientifically designed. If not then I would suggest increasing the length of the stem by 1/4 to 1/2 inch so the sphincter muscle could more easily secure the seal around the bulb end.,2434

China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me...",3986

Excel Double Clip Extra Hands With Magnifier,0/0,1.0,"I seldom write reviews, this is probably my first review on Amazon in the last five years I've been frequently using Amazon.When I initially opened the box, I found a small ""Helping Magnifier"" box that was already in rough shape. Upon opening the box, all the components (including the magnifying glass) were loosely tossed into the bag. (see pic)First thing I did; inspect the magnifying glass. It is definitely usable, but chips or simply poor manufacturing are evident all along the edges.Next up was the ""circular"" metal band for the magnifying glass (see pic). I managed to wedge the magnifier in pretty good but there is a noticeable crookedness to it. Perhaps the difficultly in assembling this component was on my behalf but the damage to the parts themselves is inexcusable for something ""new"".Lastly, assembling the actual unit requires a ""Helping Hand"" itself. Although relatively straight forward, there are no directions (but like I said, it's clear what to do.)I am giving this product one star for now but if it performs well despite the initial complaints, I may be willing to give it two stars for how cheap it was.EDIT",6722
Maximus Personal Lubricant,0/0,5.0,I am unable to put in words the wonders of this product..... either with toys and solo play or with my boyfriend. The feel is amazing and only one pump is needed and goes a long way!! Definitely worth the price. You won't regret it! It may even do wonders for your relationship!!,7224
Sun-In Sun-In Hair Lightener Spray Tropical Breeze,1/1,5.0,"This stuff is amazing. I have medium brown hair and I used it with the hairdryer for about a week and noticed my hair turning an orange color and it looks great. Also great if you want an ombre hair style by spraying it heavily on the ends and a lighter spray on the way up. I really like this and would recommend it to someone else. Just make sure not to spray more on the top of your head than the rest, otherwise you get a weird glow on top of your head.",400
Quickie Original Flexible Static Duster,0/0,4.0,"I have always been a fan of Static Dusters. I have a 3 piece set from many years ago. I wanted to go ahead & get another one as the set I have is very old (but still works). I love this duster, especially with the extended handle. It is great for ceiling fans, ceiling molding & corners, baseboards, etc. I wish the duster itself was a bit fuller, but it certainly does the job!! I would recommend this product to my family & friends.",7567
China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"Great color! It takes a few coats, but once it is on it looks great! This color is not a matte shade, it has a pearly sheen to it, so it's more of a summer shade.",2114
Multipet's Look Who's Talking Plush Sheep 6-Inch Dog Toy,1/1,5.0,"I have the cow and the sheep in these Look Who's Talking dog toys. The moo and baaa are much nicer than squeeky toys and my dogs carry them everywhere. My little Border Collier mix is especially attached to them and spends lots of time putting them all together in one place and making them talk, so it's a cute way to see a little of his herding instinct at work. My dogs are not big chewers, so these work well, but any heavy chewers would distroy them quickly (although they are sturdy for a plush toy). The sound box is durable (some over a year old and still going), but does not last forever (one gave out after about 8 months of use). However, I can probably blame my stepping on them as much as over use by the dogs.",3145
Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I am a woman with small hands, my dog is a boxer mix with large paws and claws. These trimmers are a good size for both of us. I've always used guillotine style trimmers in the past but found them awkward. I find the scissor like action of the Safari trimmer much more comfortable. I adopted my dog when he was 10 months old and for the first year he didn't need trimming. When the time finally came that he needed it, my normally good natured, happy dog growled at me. I don't know if he'd had a bad experience in the past but I wanted to be sure he had no reason to fear the trimmers. So starting out I would just trim one claw followed by a treat and a lot of praise. I would not try again for a day or two and always just one. With the Safari trimmers I could always see where I was cutting and I could take small nibbles so it never hurt him. Pretty soon he was looking forward to trim time and he would hand me his paw. We have gradually worked up to doing a whole paw at a time. He does have soft, pink and white claws, which makes it easier. But I haven't had any trouble with these trimmers crushing his claws. I am very pleased with my purchase.",9554
O'Keefes Creme,0/2,2.0,Have seen this at a local store and a friend swears by it.It is VERY long lasting but I just don't see the big deal. One small jar goes a long way and maybe that justifies the expense?,4571
Twister,0/0,5.0,"Is it normal to twist yourself in such a way that you feel like a human pretzel? And when this happens, am I winning or losing? I never could tell! This classic game that reminds me of late 60's music such as the Beach Boys, the Mamas & Papas, and Paul Revere & the Raiders is really a total blast to play with other people. I tried playing Twister alone one time and I felt like I was defeating the purpose because nobody was standing to the side to watch me hurt myself and stumble around with neverending silent facial giggles. I always feel like somebody's watching me! Truly not one of the more appropriate and proud moments of my life right there, haha. I'm referring to the embarrassment of playing alone to my old Black Sabbath albums. I'm not proud of that at all. I could care less how ridiculous my twisty, turny, awkward body movements are to the always-ready-to-humilate eyeballs watching over me!Anyway, Twister is a game for the entire family. It's sort of like an exercise routine when you really get into it. Maybe even yoga? Nah, not yoga. Entertaining in one square-shaped area on the floor that's safe and well... no, it's not really safe at all. I mean it is safe unless, like I say above, you really get into it. In that case be careful not to fall all over the place and bang your knees on the hard living room floorboards which can bruise with age and cause walking discomfort. When you walk funny you don't want people to know you were twisting the night away the night before. I do wonder if people have actual memories of playing Twister. Is it the kind of embarrassment you'd want to remember? Maybe for some folks. Maybe for me too, who knows?",650
Penthouse Secrets Collection Golden Nugget 5X Body Massager,0/0,1.0,This is NOT as advertised. These 'massagers' are cheap for a reason. It says it is a 9V battery and that it is included. It doesn't even take 9V battery -- takes 2 AA which = no power. Don't waste your time.,7117
Laxatone 2.5 oz,0/0,3.0,"The product does exactly what it says, but getting it into the cat is the issue you'll probably face. It's smells like maple syrup and my cat liked the taste, but had too much trouble eating it with dry food. It's so sticky it will clump all the food into a ball. This made it far too difficult to chew on and it got rolled around until it hardened. A few drops always wound up on the bottom of the bowl and my cat disapproved. The bottle is also a constant problem, because there's always some of this glue-like paste that runs into and around the cap. Every time you unscrew the top you'll have a mess on your hands and will eventually need to scrape the stuff off. I didn't need to use much of it so the bottle might not bother other people. This product might not cause problems with other cats, but mine always looked like she was trying to chew peanut butter and learned to avoid it.",4584

Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,5.0,"Pretty much being bald was no problem after all being around a dad,uncles and cousins with the same lack of hair made it pretty acceptable and knowing what was going to happen anyway. The only problem was the lack of a standard barber I mean I have no hair so what's the use for a stylist? So after trying many hair shaver with passing grades I found Wahl has been the most longest lasting and best hair shaver to have at such an affordable price.If You don't want to shave all your hair off or what you have left this is also a nice one to have as it gives a detailed specifications on which accessory to use when trimming your hair or if someone else in your family is doing the trimming. So if you're one of my fellow bald brothers or a receding sibling who is secure enough not to worry about trying to comb over your two hair strands then this is a perfect product to have and for those who are looking for an affordable alternative to going to a hair stylist look no farther.",8534
Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer,0/0,5.0,"This hair dryer is small and easy to handle, but the best thing is the air flow. Many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description, but this one truly has turbo air flow. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining.",5687

Toysmith Zen Garden,1/1,4.0,"When my students approach my desk, they inevitably want to touch and play with the things on it, which sometimes is a problem. This Zen Garden was my solution to this problem. Its so predictable and sweet; a student will stand at my desk, pick up the little rake and start drawing in the sand and say to me, ""Miss, what's this thing for?"" I always smile and reply, ""Just what you are doing right now."" A few have made me laugh as they continue to draw and design in the sand and say, ""Well that's dumb."" To which I reply, ""You're STILL doing it, aren't you?"" :-)I think there is something primal about playing with sand and it has brought joy to my classroom - to my students who now have a little toy and to me because they now have something they should be touching on my desk, and of course the smiles they give me when they do play with it!Is this the best one out there? No, not really. It is a little cheap. One of the legs came off, but I glued it back on. Also, its not very deep, I have to keep the whole thing in the tray that it came it to prevent sand spillage all over my desk - fortunately the box it came in has a nice black cardboard tray that doesn't detract from its appearance. This bottom is also helpful because the wooden garden itself isn't 100% level. The sand is very fine, so it leaves a powder residue around the frame - I use a small make up brush to brush this sand back into the garden.So, no it is not the best one out there, but it does do what its supposed to do and between the rocks and two garden tools it comes with (which have held up well so far - 3 months of use), it is a nice starter set at a decent price. Also, the book that contains the meditations is lovely and a nice part of the set.I had some pretty tumbled rocks I had from when I taught science and replaced the plain brown ones with them and it looks great.",2465

This is one of the few organic maple syrups that I could find. Luckily, it is also one of the best tasting.

"Petmate Ultimate Litter Scoop 22972, Colors may Vary",0/0,5.0,"I scoop three litter boxes daily - many times twice daily. I use Swheat Scoop litter. This is the best scooper I've used so far. While the handle could be a tad bit longer, it is long enough for not too much bending on my part. The material is strong enough to scoop to the bottom of the litter box and pull up any clumped litter clinging to the bottom of the box easily.The scoop strainer has large enough holes so that the litter sifts more quickly (so I don't have to spend forever shaking the scooper to separate the clumps and let the unused litter fall through.) I can see how some folks can say the holes are too big, but for my kitties' droppings, this is perfect.Mine came in the blue color, which i liked because it matches the litter box ... but really not a big deal. I really appreciate it.I also use the Litter Genie (bought in pet store - not online). I like the Litter Genie because it keeps the litter discard smells trapped. The size was better when I only scooped one box, but with three, it tends to fill up fast. I've jerry-rigged the top half of the Litter Genie to sit on top of a taller garbage container so the bag can extend longer and catch more discard. Works for me so far. I highly recommend the Litter Genie to help with smells. i have a sensitive nose and no longer smell box odors when I walk in my small apartment. Yay.",6435

"Tetra 77847 Whisper Air Pump, upto 20-Gallon",1/1,5.0,"I purchased a 20-gallon air pump made by Top Fin and this was a big mistake. The unit provided a good deal of air, but the noise it made was so loud that it could be heard from two rooms away. I was lured in by the cheap price when I should have just stuck to the Tetra brand, which I finally did after returning the Top Fin 20.The Whisper 20 is what it claims to be--whisper quiet, although this is really a subjective opinion. You can still hear some slight buzzing, but compared to other air pumps, it is relatively quite. It provides a strong stream of air for your aquarium air stones or other devices. Tetra also includes a free air valve, which is a nice touch.If you're looking for a reliable and relatively silent air pump at a reasonable price, the Whisper 20 is a product to consider.",2058

I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don't last long and I on't get soft curls with those. This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning. Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons. Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected. With loner teeth I guess this would be an ideal product for me :)",6424
Educational Insights Safe 'n' Easy Paper Cutter,0/0,4.0,This is definitely a solid and nice looking paper cutter however the reason i rated 4 stars is that it takes me a couple or three cuts to get the cut where i want it. Kind of annoying but i got used to it. The cuts are clean and the product is durable but the alignment needs to be where the clear plexiglass ends but it's not.,795
France Luxe Elysee Barrette - Classic,1/1,2.0,"This barrette is promoted as being best for those with thick hair. Although the pattern of the decorative 'onyx' is attractive, the actual holding mechanism for your hair is not nearly sturdy enough or made well enough to warrant the price. I could not get all my hair into the barrette at the same time to create a nice, low pony tail. In a nutshell, to all out there with truly THICK hair, this barrette is not worth the money and good luck getting it to do what you want it to. As a side note, I also purchased an inexpensive Goody hair product along with this order. The Goody is certainly not as fancy as the France Luxe but it holds all my hair without any problems and it was less than $7.",2625
Medi-Dyne Pro Stretch,1/1,4.0,"I had been experiencing pulled achilles tendons from running, which was causing pretty bad heel pain. I was looking for relief in any form and came across this stretching system on Amazon with good reviews. I have been using this for only a few days and have already felt relief in my achilles tendon's just from using this to stretch them a couple times throughout the day. It provides a better stretch than using a wall or staircase to stretch. All you do is position your foot in it while near a wall, using the wall to balance yourself and letting your other leg just dangle. You rock backward and you will immediately feel a stretching feeling from the back of your heel all the way up to the top of your calf muscle. You hold that for about 30 seconds than you can switch to the other foot or do again if you feel the need to stretch more. I didn't even realize how tight my calf muscles were until I used this and I will continue to use this in the future to prevent injury and prior to running.The only other recommendation and note I have is that you definitely want to have a sneaker or some sort of foot protection on when using this and not just go barefoot or with a sock. The surface and heel cup are very hard and it doesnt feel great on your foot if you don't have a shoe on, hence the 4 stars rather than 5. Other than that, this is great for anyone who wants a little help with their stretching.",366
Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush,0/0,5.0,"I used to buy this brush at a local Beauty Supply store, but it doesn't sell it anymore. It is perfect for my hair. My hair tangles easily and most brushes either tear it or are too soft to brush through it. This one is just right. I' so glad they still make it and I found it on Amazon!",792

Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,5.0,i use this and revelutin they both are wonderful product but revelution helps with ear mites and worms so if you have a cute little stray that needs a bit more care i would use revelution but after three months i put them on frontline do to the savings,4907

StarMark Clicker Dog Training System,0/0,5.0,"I have used the StarMark Clicker for several years and I love it!It is not loud like the box metal clickers. I attach the clicker to a wrist band with a rubber band, so it hangs just right for me to access it quickly. I like the shape of the clicker; it fits comfortably in my hand.I always like to keep a few on hand to give to other training enthusiasts!I have 3 dogs and they love to see me get the clicker out. This means they get to ""work"" and clicker training makes learning fun!",1350
Enersys 12V 4.5Ah SLA Rechargeable Battery for Security Systems,0/0,4.0,"My alarm system got toasted smell coming from the transformer. In case it went bad, I ordered both battery and transformer. However, the smell went away once the battery was placed, and transformer cools down quite a bit. Obviously a bad battery with 10+ years need to be replace to reduce fire hazard.There are actually cheaper ones with same part number and size. I selected this one just because it looks better.",8380

So I was happy that it was durable in that regard! It can be a one person job, however, it will save you tons of time doing it with TWO people, trust me! It has a top bracket with a safety that prevents your pet from lifting the bracket, and dumping the bottle on the ground. The only reason I did NOT give this five stars was due to the fact it drips. It states that it might DO that in the instructions, but for the $22 I expected a little more!",9319
Plush Cat House with Cats - Five (5) Stuffed Animal Cats in Play Kitten House Carrying Case,3/3,3.0,"This is all my daughter wanted for her birthday. She loves the house and each little kitten and often tells me just how cute the cats are.

The slides that were included were very cool and fun to look at. The lighting is good, and I love that it's rechargeable and can be used without the cord. It's fairly heavy and seems to be made of high-quality materials. It was well worth the additional expense for this microscope.",7501
The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),0/0,4.0,"Cats really do LOVE this toy. I wish the string was better quality - even when the cat isn't trying to chew it, it frays and eventually breaks. Also, the pole has small plastic caps on the ends that can fall off and become a hazard to a hungry feline. The feathers are great, no complaints. Buy this product and make your cat happy.",5212
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer,0/0,5.0,We have been using this seat for about 1 year now and have bought multiples for convenience and for our vacation home. This potty seat sits firmly on a variety of toilets seats keeping our son from wobbling around or falling when he tries to get off the potty. It has no sharp edges or places for his hands or fingers to get stuck. The center front is molded to have a cup like piece that helps greatly to keep him from peeing all over (since he must pee sitting down until he is tall enough to stand) I do wipe the from cup part down after he uses it but I found any mess to be minimal and definitely easy compared to cleaning out a floor sitting potty seat. We had one of those but retired it because it was so awful to clean!,7801
Clearblue Fertility Monitor 1 Count,2/2,5.0,"I lost my first child at 32 weeks. He was born sleeping. I knew right away I wanted to try again. I bought this because I read so many remarkable reviews. And the site where I chart shows great results with people who use this. First month using it and I'm now pregnant with my rainbow baby!!! I thought I wouldn't get a peak on the first cycle but I did!I can't believe it. I never imagined that I would be one of the ones who got pregnant first cycle using CB Fertility Monitor. Now I just hope it sticks. Whatever happens will happen, but I have complete confidence in this device and will definitely use it for my future planned pregnancies.Worth the money spent!!",2705
Small World Toys Imaginative Play Knight in Shining Armor - Black,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this costume set for my 2 year old son to attend a dress-up birthday party, so I didn't need anything well built or sturdy. I was pleasantly surprized when I received the costume! For the price I paid, (thirteen dollars including shipping), this is a great toy costume which will probably last through many more parties and possibly Halloween. My son is still too small (30 lbs. 37"" tall) for the perfect fit but I think I can easily make an adjustment.",761
Candy Land - The Kingdom of Sweets Board Game,0/0,3.0,"This board, along with our copy of Chutes and Ladders, is really difficult to play. Our son is a typical 4 year old but he has a hard time staying focused when we play this game. There is way too much stimulus from the bright pictures that fill up the entire board. The spaces are too close together and the gingerbread men don't fit. I hope I can find an older version of the game because while I love the concept of Candyland, this one is just too hard for us to play.",5942
Diaper Dude Diaper Bag,0/0,5.0,"I just received this diaper bag in the mail as a gift. It is more than I had anticipated it being. After reading reviews I assumed that it would be a lot smaller however it turns out that this bag is just the right size. This is my second child and I messed up the first time and had a very small diaper bag. This could actually be used as a small book bag to carry books, phone, drink and pencils and things for a college student, and it looks cool too! VERY comfortable shoulder strap and the actual shoulder pad is a little more cushioned for comfort. it seems to be well insulated and the changing pad is very nice as well. overall I feel the price that was paid for this bag was VERY reasonable considering the bag is very well made and appears worth more. 5 stars all across. I got the grey and orange and love the colors! My husband does too.",2209

My cat pulls at it pretty hard and it does not snap. This toy is also great to help bring shy cats out of their ""shell"". Just a tip...put the toy away when you're done with it!

We tried a shock collar first, but it did not work. I think our dog had too much hair in the way, plus I just didn't like the thought of shocking him. This spray of citronella worked perfectly. We had one small snag, his sister chewed the collar off him, but we secured it to another collar and he has kept it on. We were on the verge of getting rid of the dogs, so we are thankful this collar worked! Now we just have to listen to all the neighbor dogs bark -we have considered telling them about this collar.",1075

ThinkFun Zingo,0/0,5.0,"I bought this at a local store for Christmas for my son who will turn 4 in a few months. We have played it now three times in the last few days and even my daughter who turns 2 tomorrow is able to play...and kinda good at it!Each Zingo game card has two sides, a green and a red. The red is supposed to be more challenging so we have only played the green side so far. I play the dealer, who slides the red box to reveal 2 of the yellow plastic word tags at a time. The mechanism is easy to work and both my kids can do it but it's easier if I'm the dealer to keep them from being distracted. Also the tags are difficult to slide back into the dispenser one at a time through the slots. Both kids help put them in when the lid is off - they are rounded one one end and flat on the other making it easy to see which direction they face.Play is fun and it only takes about 15 minutes for someone to win, though with two toddlers we play until everyone ""wins"". My son is just starting to read and I hope that continued play helps him with his reading to link the word with the picture. My daughter easily recognizes each picture, even ""smile"", and calls them out by name, though she is not reading at all. They don't always remember what they are looking for and sometimes call out the name of whatever tag comes up even though they don't need that to make a match, but again I love the reinforcement of the picture names and words.My husband hasn't played this with us yet because we've played it while he's at work but I love that this is a game we can all play as a family. I look forward to a family game night!Santa brought us Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land too. Chutes and ladders was confusing and disinteresting to the 2 yr old and took the 4 yr old quite a few turns before he kinda got the idea. It didn't hold their attention. Candyland was more fun and very easy for both to understand since there is no counting involved. They did great, but the 2 year old again got distracted and left before game was over. Zingo kept both kids interested so I give it the best rating of these for toddlers!!!",5398

No, it isn't really a 'musical instrument' per se, but it is still heck of a lot of fun. He loves putting the pieces together to form weird and wonderful shapes, then marches around blasting away with it.

Pero Instant Natural Beverage - 7oz - Powder,0/0,5.0,"I have interstitial cystitis which means I can no longer drink coffee because of the acid. After searching online I found a low acid coffee (Puroast French Roast) which I loved but eventually had to give up also. I tried Kaffree Roma, which is similar to Pero, as a substitute for coffee and was fairly happy with it until a friend bought me some Pero. I didn't think I would like it as much just from looking at the powder. It was a lighter color and just didn't look like it would taste as good but I actually like it better. If you're like me and are looking for a good coffee substitute I found this to be the best choice.",7803

It's effin loud, no doubt, but for what it does, it's actually relatively quiet. This thing pounds out air like nobodies business. I've had this thing plugged in and running for a year straight. It gets a little warm so if you have a small fan to point at the compressor while running, it will significantly reduce the heat signature coming from the unit. This will also help the unit last longer and run better as hot operating temperature adds wear and tear to anything.",4011

"""Marineland Penguin 200B/350B/170B/330B Rite-Size C Filter Cartridge 6 pk """,0/0,5.0,"i use these in my penguin 350 on a 55 gallon community tank. normally, i will rinse them once after 3 weeks, and then replace after another 3 weeks. since there are 2 filters in the 350, i stagger their replacement at least 2 weeks apart to avoid shocking the tank. i have had this setup running for almost a year with absolutely no issues.buying a 1- or 3-pack of these filters gets pricey over a period of time. buying them in bulk is much cheaper, and ensures you will likely have more on hand in case of an emergency, when changing both filters is required.i purchased the 6-pack from amazon at $12.09 with free prime shipping, which comes to about $2 per. at petco.com, the same 6-pack costs $18.99, or $3 per. even the 12-pack at petco runs $34.96, which is just under $3 each. at this rate, you get one for free every time you buy two via amazon vs petco. also, the 6-pack on amazon sold for as low as $9 in july, which is only $1.50 per! you just can't beat that.sorry, this review became more about the cost than the product. but, after all, cost is one of the big reasons we're here buying things at all. right?",1994

PetAg KMR 2nd Step Kitten Weaning Food 14oz,1/1,5.0,"My cat has had serious problems over the last few years with gum/dental problems, and lost quite a bit of weight in the process of diagnosing and treating him. After we got the infection cleared up, his appetite was still shaky due to his association of food with pain - he was even unable to eat canned food without screaming until we got his teeth removed and the infection cleared up. My vet recommended mixing a scoop of this in with his foods and a cup or so of water to entice his appetite. It amazingly worked like a charm. He's back up to his normal 13 lb self, his coat is glossy and soft again, and his eyes are bright. Even though he's 12, he's playing like a kitten again. I know that resolving the infection had quite a bit to do with that, but if we weren't able to get him eating again, it would still be a long battle ahead.Make sure to get your cat's teeth cleaned on a regular basis - I've had 2 so far that have had this same issue, and it's a nasty infection to get rid of :(",5661
Venom Gloss,0/0,5.0,"I am completely addicted to Venom gloss. I have been using it for the past two years or so, and have finally thrown all the other partly-used tubes and tubs away. I just use this. I have extremely dry skin and the lips to go with it, and although I pay attention to staying hydrated, I need good lip protection the way a polar bear needs fur--it's just not optional. If I want to be comfortable and not have cracked, peeling lips, this is the ticket. Venom gloss stays on and on and on, all day practically if you don't eat stuff that wipes it off your mouth; and I put it on before I go to bed, too. It has peppermint (and I forget what other things) in it to give it a bit of a ""sting,"" which I really enjoy, though if it makes my lips plumper, I haven't noticed. Or cared. I just wish it came in more colors!!!",1070

After you clean, just tilt it back and you have cleaned the litter box!The only thing is, it's not really 'self-clean' like it is advertised. Maybe I am not using it correctly? In addition, it is not very easy to lock the lid and bottom in place (it just doesn't fit together perfectly) and also the 'filtering out' process still does not get the tiny poop specks out.",9352

Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,2.0,The baby dry diaper is not as good as swaddlers for leakage proof performance. It leaks quite frequently from the back side. One reason may be that my baby has some gas issue. But the swaddlers worked much better to prevent leakage by adding thicker layer on the back. I should have bought it even with the little additional cost. So be warned if you do not want to wash baby cloth that often.,9033

Graco Pack N Play Sheet,0/6,3.0,"Hey! I purchased this pack'n'play yard because it is convertible and so multifunctional which is important for us. I must say it is not so easy to assemble it. Other cons:- the changing table is inclined to the left and nothing can be done. When you put the baby on it he will roll to the left:(- the bassinet is so hard to set up, actually my husband had to apply so much effort to establish it. I don't think any woman can do it- wheels are only on one side, thus means you cannot roll the crib to sooth your baby.- the crib is rather small especially when your baby is longPros:- it is convertible nevertheless:)- has mp3 speaking system- I love especially diaper containers on the side. This allows you to have everything within reach.Overall it's not bad and I give it 3 out of 5. Never tried play yard as of yet so cannot say much about it.",1976

"Conair Supreme Triple Curling Iron Pack - 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch and 1 inch",0/0,1.0,"Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS IRON PACK. I got mine a while ago and they don't hold my curls AT ALL. It was pure disappointment and I strongly suggest you not to make the same mistake I made. I'd give it 0 star if I could. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!!",2958
Thermalon Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat Cold Neck Wrap For Neck And Shoulder,0/0,2.0,"I ordered this because I wanted another moist heat heating pad, and I have used it a couple of times. Unfortunately, even when heating it to the max recommended time in the microwave it only holds heat for about 10 or 15 minutes at the max. Because I ordered this heating pad to be a secondary one (I use the Bed Buddy as my main heating pad, and it holds heat for about an hour) I'm not going to go through the trouble to return it, but I am disappointed that I paid $18 for something that essentially doesn't work. I'll have to try it as a cold pack and see if that works better.Also, it has a pretty strong, bad smell.I gave it two stars because the ties are nice and the beads didn't pour out like some other reviewers have warned about.",7731
Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer,0/0,5.0,I ordered this item for my first baby on the way :) It looks just like the pic and I'd say is a little bigger than an I phone so it fits comfortably in my hand. So excited to try it out thanks!,5269

Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller,1/1,5.0,"Bought this stroller because my 2 year old would not sit in our single stroller and we now have a 4 month old. We traveled for Christmas and this stroller was perfect for the airport and visits to stores. It is a bit heavy, but what else can you expect from a double stroller? It folds up almost as well as our City Mini but is a little bulkier. Overall this is the smallest double I have seen.This stroller is also very sturdy. My very active toddler was swinging from the handle with nothing else attached to the stroller and it did not flip or even fall over. I also love that the back &#34;seat&#34; is adjustable, sliding back and forth to where your child prefers it. (The seat belt in the back was also a must for us) There are lots of ways your older child can ride. This stroller is perfect for anyone with two small children..",7992

Amarelli Spezzata Licorice 40g pastilles by Amarelli,0/0,5.0,"This is definitely not your standard licorice candy. It's very sharp and kind of bitter, with a very distinct and long-lasting aftertaste. Personally I think it's great, and am ordering more right now, but don't expect it to taste anything like anything you'd find in the candy section. Try chewing some anise or fennel, which you can find at more upscale grocery stores. It tastes a bit like that.",2643
Ortho Molecular Product Natural D-Hist -- 120 Capsules,0/0,5.0,"I work at a public school, so I'm surrounded by people with viruses. I developed a horrible cold in October, which lasted over a month. MD's visits and OTC meds were worthless. After using Ortho's D-Hist (plus the SinuPulse Elite Advanced Nasal Sinus Irrigation System), I got better quickly.The real test came about three days ago, when I started feeling a cold coming on again. After taking D-Hist again immediately, three days later feeling 100% again. Highly recommend.",4864
"Hypafix Dressing Retention Tape- 4"" x 10 yds - Each",0/0,5.0,"Item arrived promptly and in good condition.The price is reasonable. I loved this tape when I was a practicing RN, and still love it as a patient. Once the body heat grips it, it will stay in place until you actually peel it off off for the next dressing. Does not hurt to remove. Do not put in it directly on wound, but it will hold most dry & moist treatments without leakage. Wonderful stuff.",4271

Nutrex Niox,1/1,3.0,"This product didn't live up to my expectations.Being from nutrex, i expected the best. And being from Amazon, I expected the correct product to be in the picture (as of now they show Volu Gro).I feel something of a NO pump after taking this. Stamina goes up, strength goes up a little, and veins become slightly larger (nowhere near the advertised pictures of NYC subway maps sticking out of someone's arm).That being said, get the original Jack3d while you can (being pulled from market soon). It is much more potent NO pump and has other effects making it by far the best pre-workout I have ever used. (Jack3d micro is not the same as Jack3d fyi).Also taking 12 pills a day kinda sucks. They arent big but they taste a bit foul and its just a lot of pills. (looks super incriminating to take in public)Overall, glad I tried it. I use it before college rugby games where jack3d is banned, but other than that not worth the money. Stock up on Jack3d.Note for the future. This product mixed with a Cellucor or other pre-workout may combine to be almost as good as jack3d once that's gone.",1225

Spill Proof Paint Cups - Set of 4,0/0,5.0,The tops close tightly so that little hands cannot easily get them open once I'VE decided they should be closed. The design of the place where the brush enters the container gives me time to grab the container from my son BEFORE the pain goes everywhere. The tight cap also saves paint. It's durable plastic.

"MG217 Medicated Tar Ointment, Psoriasis Treatment, Intensive Strength, 3.8 oz.",0/0,4.0,"I've had Psoriasis since I was a kid. I'm now nearing 30 and I've yet to find something that helps- until now. Short of using prescription shampoos and creams, this is the best stuff I've tried OTC. After just a few applications, I noticed a difference in the areas that have been bugging me on my scalp.There IS some odor (think T-Gel), but it's not strong and it does wash off your hands with one wash. The cream can be a little greasy but does absorb into the scalp quite well- You won't immediately need to wash this out a few hours after application.I have moderate-severe scalp Psoriasis, as well as atopic Excema and some other skin issues, and I must say this is by far the best OTC product I've come across so far. Would be 5 stars if not for the slight odor and mild greasyness.",4084
Amazon.com,0/0,5.0,"Most bags are way too big for schlepping a few incidentals. In mine I carry pen/pad (in a pocket designed for that), shades, phone, change, hand sanitizer, keys, etc., with plenty of room to spare. A smallish paperback or e-reader fits nicely. Sturdy construction. Completely zippers up, so no more spilling your stuff all over. It has a nice masculine look, splits the difference between too girly or outlandishly faux commando. If mine ever wears out (not likely). I'll get another.",8093

I had forgotten how it scented all my little apartment with a clean but not perfumy scent. Recently I rediscovered the soap again at Amazon. Most soap is made of lard and lye - ugh!

At 300 mg two times a day, Phosphatidyl Serine was recommended to me by a nutritionist. I originally bought it at GNC at $39.99 for a bottle of 30 softgels. It made a huge difference, especially when taken with DMAE, Lecithin, and selenium. I'm just starting the Source Naturals Phosphatidyl Serine Matrix product. It's a lot cheaper, and the mg are higher. So far, it has met my expectations!",2669

We bought some other clippers at the grocery store or drug store and they were awful - not as good as the old ones. So I decided to shop for a better quality clipper and got these Seki fingernail and also some Seki toenail clippers. I never thought that nail clippers could be this good. I love them.

LifeEssence - The Master Multiple,1/1,5.0,"I am 72 years old and I have taken close to 50 different multi-vitamins in my life. I believe this is the best. It gives you a lot of energy. I have no cons to list. I take 2 tablets with my breakfast, one with lunch, & one with dinner. I noticed in some reviews people were taken 2 or 3 tablets per day.

Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,1/1,1.0,"I bought this based on reviews & a recommendation from a client with beautiful hair color. Big mistake. It turned my dark honey blonde hair COPPER orange with orange juice-colored highlights & left my hair brittle & dry. I was convinced that my hair was going to fall out. I couldn't believe the color. I fixed my hair (sort of) after several processes of stripping it & re-coloring it over the past 3 months. I also had to chop off 3 inches because of this dye & how it left my hair. I ended up ""fixing"" it by stripping it with Kenra lightener & then re-coloring with a few John Frieda foams. I'm still not out of the woods. I'll have to keep cutting my hair as it grows out because it's been damaged so badly by this dye. It will be years before my hair is back to an acceptable state. I hate this dye!!! Never again!Thankfully, the John Frieda dye has restored some of the texture back into my hair & returned it to a healthier condition. My hair felt better even after bleaching than after this dye. I still can't believe how bad this ended up turning out. Also, the smell is just as bad as any other ""toxic"" dye. Burned my eyes & scalp & bothered my bf who wasn't even in the bathroom with me as I dyed.",492

I tried allowing the popcorn to release steam when it was done popping and transferred to my popcorn bowl. I've never had to work to help popcorn come out crispy and fluffy. May have been an old and expired lot, but it should have been thrown out and not sold to consumers. Will not take a chance on this product again.",3180

Just pour dry contents of pouch into 2 quart round bowl, add 2 1/4 cups water and 2 tablespoons salad oil, microwave on high 12-13 minutes and that's it!

Dermalogica Clearing Skin Wash,0/0,5.0,"Hi, I tried a sample of Anti Bac and loved it! The replacement product is the Medibac line which is based on Salylic acid, which SUX!

Even Benziol Peroxzide is much better if going the chemical route, while I preferred the natural Anti Bac wash and it is the ONLY product they have that works for acne in a more natural way.

"Jason Natural Cosmetics - Aloe Vera (Super Gel) 98%, 16 fl oz gel",0/0,2.0,"This gel is very sticky and sweet, also seems not completely absorbed (50% is absorbed and 50% dry on the skin surface and then seems to peel).I had to mix it with other creams, in two equal parts (mix with cream for very dry skin).It also works better if you mix it with drops of essential oil or olive oil. (5 drops of oil per arm or leg, if you still feel sticky or syrupy, to the next (the next day after the bath), repeat the formula but with more oil until you get the desired sensation.",9671

Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Sodor Dairy Cars,1/1,3.0,I got these for my son. They are really cute trains but they came not working. I had to change the batteries and they still didn't work properly. When I get a new item I shouldn't have to change the batteries. When we did change the batteries the moo wouldn't go off every-time expected. We return and go a new one that worked fine but did have to change the batteries again.,7229

Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler,0/0,4.0,"I love my lashes curled but I never found a mechanical curler that didn't pinch or pull lashes or create fake looking curls. Once you get the hang of this heated curler you will use it every day. The natural looking curl lasts very well if you are using mascara - apply mascara first then curl! one star off because this thing uses up batteries like crazy, and there is no auto magic shut off so if you forget to turn it off that's a battery down the tubes. I am going to invest in rechargeable though, that's how much I love this thing!",3539

Carex Bed Buddy Joint Wrap (2-Pack),0/0,5.0,"This Joint wrap is the best product I've come across for people who suffer any kind of joint, neck, shoulder, or lower back pain. You just pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds, turn it over and 30 seconds again, and you have nice warm moist heat for at least an hour. It is so soothing for joint pain, I even tried it on my German Shepherd with hip dysplacia and he thouroughly enjoyed it because it put him right into a deep sleep. Then I tried it on my hyper female GSD who has a very hard time relaxing, I put it on her hip area and she also fell into a very deep trance and then she fell into a deep sleep. This is so unusual for her to be this relaxed, and I am happy to say it works just as well on humans!! The price is right on Amazon, and I couldn't find this product in any retail stores!",6391

Avon Solutions Nurtura Replenishing Cream,0/0,5.0,"This cream is nice but on the thicker side. I love how it feels on my skin but I will not need to be using it daily as a night cream.

"Crushed Watermelon Seed, 4 oz.",0/0,4.0,"I love this tea. It's a milky color with a slightly sweet creamy taste. I use it as a base for my green smoothies in the morning, and I add it to the hibiscus/olive leaf tea I drink throughout the day. It cuts through the acidity and bitterness in the hibiscus/olive leaf.I've been drinking the hibiscus tea for several years, which has a strong diuretic effect, and haven't noticed that the watermelon seed tea has made it any worse. I also don't know whether it would have that effect on its own.The instructions say to make it fresh every day but I make 4 cups every other day and store the extra in the fridge.I'm using it because I read it was good for my blood type. I don't have kidney problems.The only thing that would make it better was if the seeds were organic.",1500
Dana Heaven Sent Vanilla Eau de Parfum,0/0,4.0,"The fragrance is very nice, but not much vanilla. It's inoffensive enough for everyday wear and any occasion, though. Musky floral about sums it up. I'm glad I got the half-ounce sample, but would probably not rebuy.",1178

When one settles down to chew on a dinosaur, I have to find the other one for the other dog or she will look at her sister with envy and try to take the dinosaur away from her. I can give them a dinosaur as a substitute for chewing on the furniture. I will certainly buy this product again.",918
Avigal Henna 100% Natural Hair Color BLACK Intense Ebony 4.5 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"I followed the directions in the package (hot water, henna, and some olive oil)...I let it stay 2 hrs and then rinsed with some conditioner. With my long hair, the application was a mess! The mixture came apart easily and fell everywhere - sink, counter, and floor! A little got on my hand, which discolored the area. I was disappointed with the coverage on the gray hair and had to apply the henna again in the area I have the most grays (20 -25% gray). The second application was more successful. Perhaps, I will try the other reviewer's recommendation next time. This product did take the redish color out of my hair and it made it look healthy and shiny. I would rate this product 3 1/2 stars!",1535

Ravensburger Make 'N' Break - Family Game,1/1,4.0,"This is a pretty fun game for kids. On a player's turn a card is drawn with an image of a structure that the player has to build with the blocks. Some require the same colored blocks in the exact places, and other cards only require the structure, so colored blocks can be used any way desired. There is a timer and a player can build as many structures as they're able until the timer goes off. There are also two decks of cards, an easier group and a harder group. Even with me using the harder cards and my 8 y.o. using the easier ones, I really had to purposefully slow myself down in order to make the game seem close and not beat her with a landslide.Our daughter loves games and we try to find games that we can play with her without us having to ""dumb ourselves down"" (for lack of a better description) and pretend it's harder than it is in order to play it with her. There are a lot of games out there that adults can play with kids in which they can fully use their own skills and knowledge which makes it more enjoyable (forbidden island is a great example and is our current favorite kids game). To us it feels patronizing and untruthful to have to ""pretend"" that a game is harder or more interesting than it really is in order to play it with our daughter. We'd rather play games that really are engaging for all ages rather than pretending that they are.If you have kids that will play together then this game would be great for them. For adults playing with kids, you'll have to pretend it's harder than it is or else you'll easily beat the kids which isn't very fun or fair for them.",1781

Body Back Buddy & Mini-BBB Self Massage Tool Duo,1/1,5.0,"The Body Back Buddy is amazing. I can't function without it, in fact I take it with me when I travel as I use it almost every day. I have very bad knots and tightness in my upper back and shoulders and using the Back Buddy totally relieves the tension. It doesn't replace a therapeutic deep tissue massage but it helps me out tremendously between massages. I use it almost exclusively on the one area of my upper back that has issues but I find it does also work well in my neck and other areas of my back. I highly recommend this product.",1272
"Pero Instant Natural Beverage, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)",1/1,5.0,"I love this product. Pero is so satisfying and full bodied, richer than a cup of coffee with no caffeine.

"Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus Tea, 15 Tea Pouches",0/0,5.0,"In the past I never thought that there could be so much difference between tea and tea. I had noticed Might Leaf teas for a long time but mainly because of their name. I thought that it is a clever name. Typically we don't think of leaves as mighty (maybe the trunk of a plant but not the leaf).Then one day I found myself with an upset stomach in a coffee shop. Coffee was not an option so I was asking for Chamomile Tea. Indeed I was offered Chamomile Citrus from Mighty Leaf and fell in love with it right away, never mind my upset stomach. Since typically chamomile is my least favorite tea I tried the other flavors too. My absolute favorite is Green Tea Tropical. Summing it up",9993

I would highly recommend it.",3433
Nylabone Dura Chew Bone,0/0,5.0,"It's not me you want to consult with about this product, but since my dogs can't type, I will pass on their opinion, which is that Nylabone makes the BEST chew bones of anyone! The material that they are made from is quite durable, although eventually it will be reduced in size. The only problem we have ever had with Nylabone chew toys is with the larger Galilieo bones, The dogs chew the ends down to a point, and a few of our dogs have cracked a tooth on the toy when its gets worn down this way. We have learned to cut off the sharpened edges, which leaves a blunt end.",6193
Revlon ColorSilk Beautiful Color Hair Coloring Products,2/2,5.0,"For someone who has been dying their hair every month for the past four years, I've learned a thing or two about hair dye, and this brand is by far my favorite. Not only is it less damaging to your hair (and wallet) than other dyes, but they have the best selection of reds! I receive a lot of compliments on how natural and pretty the color is whenever I use the Bright Auburn or Light Auburn shades, and find that even the faded color is quite pretty. Like all red hair dye, it tends to fade quickly, but I've found that with proper care the color can stay pretty vibrant up to about two weeks, holding the redish tones for three or four. I'd recommend this brand for anyone considering going a ginger tone or anyone who doesn't want to fry the hell out of their hair with other boxed dyes. Overall, perfect hair dye at the perfect price!",320

I have not purchased it from Amazon yet, but I will since their price is really good on this food. My biggest suggestion for seeing if a dog would like this food or not is to only buy a can or 2 unless you know someone who would take the rest off of you before you buy a case of it. I think feel that merrick is a very high quality food, and I have never had an issue with it. I highly recommend this food.",9359

Hamadi Shea Leave In,0/0,2.0,I have the shea spray and saw rave reviews on this leave in so thought I would try it..not too impressed. First of all it was VERY expensive and the ingredients weren't very different from other leave ins I have tried that weren't as expensive. I used it once...about a nickel size amount and knew I would never use it again so I contaced the seller to return it and I was going to have to return it as a used item and have a percentage taken off and pay for return shipping. This little bottle was almost $40...give me a break!!! If I bought directly through Amazon I could have returned it for a full refund...just like if I would have bought it from the salon. From now on I will only deal directly with Amazon. I am keeping it and putting it the graveyard hair product box. Huge disappointment!,1784
3M Office PRE-MOISTENED WIPES 80 CT ( CL610 ),1/1,5.0,"I bought the wipes for about $9 and I would say it worth the money. This wipes away the sticky dirt; but, it won't completely got away. If I turn off my monitor and look at it closely; I can still notice the mark. However, for my general use, I never realized that the small dirt mark was still there. Overall it works pretty great for my 25&#34; LCD monitor. I spent $100 on my monitor; so, I don't want to spend too much for the monitor. If you got an expensive monitor and your eyes are very sensitive, then you might want to try another brand that has better review.",9045

ST 37 ANTISEPTIC LIQUID Size,1/1,5.0,"Like everyone else, my dad SWORE by this stuff and even my grandmother once used it on a terrible burn on her son in the 1930s. She was poor as dirt but would spend the money on the blue bottle of ST37 because it worked on so many things.I had my grandkids for four days the first week of January. I dabbed some of this on my one year old grandson's ezcema because it was so irritated and he was scratching like crazy. He seemed like he really enjoyed with I would apply it and I only did so maybe 5-6 times. My daughter couldn't believe how much improved it was when she returned. She said other products have only reduced the irritation but the ST37 actually healed it up!Researched main ingredient and see that it's used in age spot treatment. Naturally, I have been dabbing on a tiny bit each am and pm and no kidding, it is lightening these age spots I've had for YEARS. I'm going to buy some for each of my kids and their families!",6706

Mueller Hg80 Hinged Knee Brace,0/0,2.0,"The hinges work great but the elastic and nylon/neoprene material is not thick or long lasting. After 2 weeks usage, I am unable to get a firm hold with the velcro fasteners due to stretching of the material shell.

After some online research I came across SnapCircuits. I have never purchased anything like this before, so I decided to just order the small set and see if we liked it.It was a hit! (I am not sure who likes it more - my daughter or my husband!) The ""toy"" is very sturdy and the parts are easy to identify. In addition to providing a basic overview of circuits, this activity helps with attention to detail, how to interpret visual diagrams, and problem solving. (It is easier to make a mistake than it may appear at first glance, and my daughter has had to slow down and pay attention, which is great!)We will definitely purchase more SnapCircuits!",472

Source Naturals L-Glutamine 500mg,0/0,2.0,"Honestly I don't know how to rate these. I am rating it relative to what good I expect them to be to the typical buyer... which is little, if any. I doubt these will harm you in any way, and they are certainly not unreasonably priced.In the summer I was trying to seriously improve my physical conditioning with regular workouts focused on building up muscle mass. I thought I'd try these to help in body recovery from those.I can't say objectively that they made any difference whatsoever. I can find no scientific support to show that this supplement contributes notably to any situation. All the ""data"" is testimonial.. which is pretty useless.As winter has set in, I have become far less motivated and have let my condition deteriorate... well at least I no longer have sore muscles from conditioning exercise.I think ONLY if you're on a SERIOUS conditioning program that leaves you with notable muscle soreness of the ""good kind"" (the kind you get when you know you're stressing and rebuilding muscle.. not injuries), then you might use these to the extent you think it helps.However, if you're in any other situation...

I start and end my day with a glass of tea more often than not. The yogi java herbal tea is one of my favorites. It tastes good and I know it's good for me which just makes it that much better.

Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,0/0,3.0,"Bought this as a gift for my grandchild, keep in mind I have bought/collected Lionel trains for over 50 years, for Christmas. I started out a couple months back with Thomas set to see how he would take care of it. Since he did very well I decided to move him up to the ""O"" gauge Polar Express since he was infatuated with the movie, etc. We set it up on Christmas Day and it was a treat for all until about 1 hr later it stopped working. I called Lionel the next day and explained the symptoms to wit they said the engine was shorted and needed repair. I could send it in and get it back in 3 or 4 weeks, bring it locally for repair (2 months) or return it for a refund. I decided to return it and order a replacement. Received my replacement from AMAZON the next day (THEY ARE THE GREATEST!!!!!) and have shipped the old one back for refund.It is really too bad that these have to be made in China now because they are nowhere near the quality of what we expect from Lionel. The box says they are located in Chesterfield, IL but I have been there and there are only maybe 3 people left at that facility. Most personnel are now located in N. Carolina, and Ohio. Another American industry, known for high quality, now producing inferior goods outside the USA. LIONEL, Inc,,,,please get your act together and bring the quality back to the model train industry and make these in the US.I am hoping this was an fluke but I see others who have experienced issues. When they work it is great....time will tellI would be real sad if it were not for the customer service at Amazon. BTW, the customer service at Lionel was very prompt and courteous too. If yours works these are a great choice. I gave it 3 stars because I expected, for the price, that this train would be QC'd and work. Here's hoping that this unit lasts many years. I have other Lionels that are over 70 years old and running great....I don't think these new units are up to that longevity. Happy New Year to all the other Polar Express lovers out there...it is always great to hear the bell ringing, no matter what your age.",5769

The little tool that it comes with to help pick up didn't seem all that helpful...as our older neice said it was just easier to pick beads up with her fingers.",5376

Flowbee Hair Cutter,0/0,5.0,"Okay, I just took delivery of a current (Nov 2012) Flowbee haircutting system w/the Super Mini-Vac for ~$140 (including shipping) direct from the company, and just tried it out. I'm happy to report that it worked great, did a great job, it was fast, clean (if a bit noisy), and that Mini-Vac was more than powerful enough for the job. I previously bought a used Flowbee which (sort of) connected to a regular vacuum cleaner, and it worked okay, but I would spend at least 20 mins to a half-hour scrubbing that thing across my head, trying to get it to cut my hair, which it eventually did. Maybe it was because it was old, or maybe it was because my vacuum cleaner wasn't strong enough, but after a few years I had to work harder and hard to get the thing to work. Eventually, the poor thing died on me. It was still worth the $$ as I still saved $15 a pop (plus another $5 tip) from going to the barbershop. Hopefully, it'll still be working fine 10 years from now - now *that* would really make it totally worthwhile.",2670

Twinlab Super E Complex,1/1,5.0,"My boyfriend started using this product about two months ago after I had read online that when used together with Saw Palmetto and Turmeric/Curcumin it has been known to help relieve the pain of Chronic Epididymitis, a very painful testicular disease.For the first month he started using this product only twice per day, and together with the other two products noticed a massive improvement. Within two weeks he was able to get out of bed again and last a full day at work. At the start of the second month he began taking the Vitamin E along with the other two products three times per day and now at the start of his third month he is practically back to normal with a full return of his quality of life.The dark glass jar helps keep this product fresh no matter where you store it, and having used other twinlab products before I can say that the quality is excellent, PLUS it's not synthetic, it's natural vitamin E! If you're considering using this product I would have to recommend it! We have been happy with all of our twinlab products so far. Great quality and value absolutely worth every penny!",3378

Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"Performance-wise, this is probably trimmer on the market. The stock blade is sharper than any other blade I've used as is. However, this is NOT a beginner tool by any means. This blade took me several attempts on several different occasions to properly zero-gap, meaning to get it to a point where it won't break the skin and won't compromise performance. Even so, after all that frustration, it requires a very very light touch. I probably would not recommend dragging this blade along your skin, right-side up & zero-gapped, as you will probably injure your client. I'm sure this will get a little better after the breaking in period. If you are a novice, I would recommend another trimmer, probably an Andis Outliner II since the blade is a lot more manageable while zero-gapped, while still giving you a sharp line. If you have several years of experience and a light touch, I think you should try this trimmer as this blade is a HITTER out the box. However, prepare to tinker with it repeatedly.",6869

PetSafe Electronic Pet Feeder,0/0,5.0,"This feeder is PERFECT. I have a miniature pinscher and she has to be fed at very exact times of the day. With this feeder, I get to make sure that I'm giving her the correct amount of food for her three meals a day AND I get to give her a Greenie to give her something to chew on in the middle of the day. I couldn't ask for more!I had been apprehensive about purchasing this feeder because of some of the reviews about difficulties in programming it. I didn't have a single problem. I'm starting to think that the people who had difficulty just chose to not read the instructions, which are VERY simple. The feeder WILL repeat your feeding schedule. You can program up to 12 feeding times. I only use four (three for food, one for the Greenie). I set the feeder up at 7:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 7:30 p.m. and it repeats that schedule every day. I had attempted to use the Bistro automatic feeder, and let me just say that that made me wary of using an automatic feeder ever again. It never could dispense the correct amount of food, even after I made some modifications to it. Now, that problem no longer exists. I know exactly how much food is being given to my dog and at what time.If you're looking for a simple feeder that is VERY reliable, then look no further. Seriously...there's almost no reason to be disappointed with this product if that's all you're needing. Whether you're getting this for a big or small dog or a cat, you just can't beat this.",1052

Neutrogena Neutrogena T/Sal Therapeutic Maximum Strength Shampoo,1/1,5.0,"My daughter has Native American heritage from her father's side, so she has extremely dark, course, heavy hair. It has natural wave to it so she straightens it often. She started noticing terrible flaking at her crown and her hairdresser said it looked like build-up of some sort. Because her hair is so dark the flakes showed up really well. As a teenager this was a serious self confidence issue. We tried ""clean"" shampoos to no avail. We swapped to ""dry scalp"" shampoo-still nothing. We knew it was not dandruff so I decided to pick up some T-Sal as a last resort. Thankfully, it works wonderfully! Her hair dresser also suggested a cheap deep conditioner so we went with the 3 Min repair by Aussie. She uses this shampoo every other wash with the 3 min conditioner and her hair is more healthy than I have ever seen it, and flake free!But the hairdresser did mention that using a ""reparative"" conditioner could cause breakage when used with T-Sal. So be wary of the conditioner you buy.",1423

However, after only a couple of uses, the tiny stopper on top of the bottle broke off into the bottle. I notified the company of this, and they defended the product by stating that I may have been too forceful in trying to open the bottle. The stopper is so tiny, that it's difficult to get a good grip on the thing in order to open it. I don't believe I was too forceful; I believe the stopper should have a more manageable top portion, for ease of opening. The company did refund me $3.00, which I applied towards a new bottle of fragrance.",2477

He would soak a pull up and I thought there was no way this could work. I was afraid to committ because I didn't want interrupted sleepless nights....However, I must say, he did GREAT! The first few weeks were a bit rocky but in no time he was dry at night. The chart helped keep him involved and he would be so excited when he had a dry night. He has been dry for about 6 months. He just had an accident last night and it reminded me to get on here and give this product a great review. Because of it, the last 6 months have been great for him and for us. It gave him confidence and I wished I had heard of and bought it sooner. Stick with it and don't give up. Buy reusable bedpads to go with it. You won't believe what this product can do for your child. Just be consistent and stick with it.",5330
Fake Bake Tanning Lotion Self Tanner 6 Oz,0/0,5.0,"I have used many self tanners and even spray tanning booths. This product by far gives the most natural look when used properly.

100% Organic West African Shea Butter,0/0,5.0,"I have 4b hair, Your typical african coily hair. I use this in conjunction with jojoba oil and my hair is softer and shinier. Heat the butter and use about a teaspoon and a half of jojoba oil. Mix it up. I really cant tell the difference between ""real"" and fake butter but I have been ordering shea butter online for years and its the only thing that has gotten my hair too grow. I was using Ultra Sheen, Pink Lotion, stuff called Super Grow, Doctor Miracle, Castor Oil and my hair didnt grow. Often it fell out.I use Organix Moisture Milk shampoo and no conditioner. (for my hair only! You may want a conditioner) Or sometimes I use Mane and Tail deep conditioner maybe once a month. I noticed for my hair, when I use a conditioner, my hair shrinks to the scalp unlike when just shampooing my hair is a bit looser. While wet, i do a two strand twist and moisturize with the butter and jojoba oil. In the morning, my hair is still a lil damp but its shiny and so soft. After a week, my hair is still soft.",499

BABYBJORN Potty Chair,0/0,5.0,"Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't ""use"" them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the ""talking"" potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.",9180

It was a bit slow to arrive, but no complaints for something so hard to find. The product is straight Ammonia, so if your expecting low-odor because it's a powder you will be disappointed. Working with this at all will fill your work area with light Ammonia fumes. Other than that, if your ordering this, you should know what your doing. I used it to make smelling salts, and although it does tend to clump, it works very well.",4008

Enjoy Luxury Conditioner (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"Ordered this on a recommendation from someone else who has naturally curly hair. Love the Deva Curl products for my hair but this conditioner is amazing! Having curly hair it needs to be wet everyday to style. I was washing my hair 3+ times a week and just wetting it the other days. New tip I learned---get it wet everyday and condition it. Especially if you have curly hair it gets frizzy so easy! Now I just wash 2x a week or less. This is truly a luxurious conditioner and a little goes a LONG way!!! I usually the size of a dime to a nickel and my hair is long, down to the middle of my back. Definitely worth the money. But add it to your wish list and watch for the pricing. Can range from $17-25 a bottle. I waited until it was around $18. One down fall--the design. This stuff is so thick it doesn't come out of the bottle well. Softer plastic that you can squeeze would help with that. Been using this for 2 months now.",8067

"Rainbow Light, Multivitamin",1/1,5.0,"I ordered "" RejuvenAge 40+ Multi"" which requires 4 pills per day. I have a hard time taking vitamins in the past. Either I get a migraine headaches or an upset stomach. My head would be pounding so hard that I had to lay down or the nausea so strong I felt a need to vomit. I would watch my urine go from almost clear to a ""deep orange"". I could smell the dreaded stench vitamin smell in my urine.I tried GNC Women's Mega, I got the same results.

I have been an avid user of this conditioner. The old formula was MILES better. It is now MUCH more watered down, has a completely different consistency, color, and odor, and the way my hair reacts to this new formula is not they way it did before. Now, it really over coats my hair making it limp and greasy looking. YUCK. (Only use a dime sized amount too!)I have read other reviews about loyal, disappointed customers of KERASTASE speaking of this new formula and how bad it is now. It is too bad. I now think this is an over priced, drug store type of product.In closing, this is NOT the sellers fault. I have ordered this a few times and the formula (new) is the same every time I purchase this new formula. Disappointing as described.Sorry, over-priced, Kerastase, you have lost a customer.",3229

The figure was very satisfactory in paint job but my figure's feet were uneven so he couldn't stand on his own. I have tried to bend them back without trying to break anything but to no avail. Also, I have heard horrendous stories of people trying to put on his replacement arm with disastrous results, like breaking off the initial clothed arm part, so I have not tried doing that.

Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Smooth Moisturizing Lotion 10.3 fl oz. (One Bottle).,3/3,5.0,"I have looked for Aveeno Positively Smooth Lotion at four different stores over the past few months and it is NO WHERE. Now I learn here that Aveeno has discontinued this item.Figures. I find a product I totally love because it works so good, and WHAM! They take the damn stuff away from me. I am MAD. In fact, mad enough that I' writing to Aveeno to ask then to please bring this back. I hope you all will join me in this.This is what I sent to Aveeno:""I've used Aveeno Positively Smooth Moisturizing Lotion since it was first put on store shelves. Now I cannot find it ANYWHERE. From what I have heard, you've discontinued the product. If this is true, I (and MANY OTHERS) would like you to please re-consider this action. If you will not be producing the Postively Smooth Lotion, I will no longer bother purchasing any Aveeno products at all. Positively Smooth Body Wash and Shave Gel are still available, but they are not as good, and I have no interest in them. At the least, I would like to know the reason that Aveeno has chosen to discontinue a product that so many of us came to love and rely on.""The contact form can be found here.This is bull. Someone on Amazon is taking full advantage of this matter by posting the only listing for this product at the price of $65!No Aveeno Positively Smooth Lotion? NO MORE AVEENO, PERIOD.I'd like to recommend switching to Veet or Nair Cream Hair Removers. In the past, cream depilatories were something I could NOT use. They smell horrid, did not do a very good job with hair removal, and ALWAYS left a chemical burn on my skin even though I removed it right away.Today's formulations are much different. They still stink like hell, but they effectively remove all unwanted hair, and leave skin smooth and soft for about 2 weeks. They come with a sponge to smooth the cream on. I leave it on for the shortest duration noted in the instructions, and then rinse off with a gentle Buff Puff Sponge thoroughly in the shower. Hope this helps some of you. If you're skin is highly sensitive, you may want to avoid the Buff Puff method, or avoid cream depilatories completely. I just know it used to be too harsh for me and did not work, and now the results are much different.Aveeno Contact Form is at:[... ](People wonder why I kinda HORDE products that I like....This is why.)",511

"Capsule Connection, CAPSULE FILLER MACHINE FOR SIZE ""0""",0/0,4.0,"I bought this machine a while back. You have to read and follow the directions. If a capsule gets stuck you can use tweezers to remove it. I'm able to fill plenty of capsules to use, but I always lose a few. There are some holes on my device that are tight fitting and when I finish making the capsules and try to push them out, (the device has an easy way to do that), a few of the capsules will stick and only half the capsule will fall out. Sometimes I can still get the capsule together, but there are always some I toss in the garbage.It takes some concentration when putting the caps in the holes. If you start daydreaming you'll lose track and forget which holes you've put them in. I have a hard time telling which ones are still empty when I've done that.When you've finished, it's easy to clean up the machine. All in all I'd say I like the machine for the most part and would probably buy it again.",2102

It is sturdy, and has quite a bit to do on it that my kid enjoys (especially the things you spin). He started using it at 3 months old (he's a pretty large baby), and loves to bounce in it.The seat height is adjustable so you can raise it as your child gets bigger (three height settings). It has an average footprint, so if you live in a smaller house it might take up a bit of space, but otherwise it should be fine. The product seems to be holding up well, and it was very easy to put together.",1464

I made 35 little bags out of the 2lb package. I got the bags from a craft store and tied them with lego colored ribbon. I don't think you would want a child eating more than the 2 oz in one sitting. It is hard candy that is clearly all sugar. You could build with the candy which was cool. I did have a peanut allergy at the party and the mom said she checked it on line and he was able to eat it.

Wella Color Charm 50 Light Drabber 1.4oz,0/0,2.0,After reading other reviews here I had high hopes that this product would mean the end to brass in my dyed blonde hair. So I added two capsful to the L'Oreal extra light blonde tint/developer I buy at the drugstore. At first I was ecstatic at the cool ashy color I obtained after this process. But one week and two shampoos later the brass has started to reassert itself. What a disappointment! I've now ordered the Wella White Lady toner to see if its more purple color (as opposed to the blue in this one) will cancel out the yellow better and longer. Still I'd love to know why this Wella product essentially washed out. I did wait 48 hours before an initial shampoo.,6057

According to my sister, I &#34;won Christmas&#34; with this toy. She likes hitting the different squares and starts waving her arms like a little conductor and dancing to it. And from what I heard from the video, as many other reviewers have said, it is not nearly as annoying as many noise-making kids' toys. The music, though obviously &#34;electronic,&#34; sounds like actual music and not beeping or buzzing or any of the other irritating toy sounds. Hopefully she will continue to enjoy it.",5352

Monoi Tiare Coconut Oil,2/2,1.0,"I've been using Monoi oils for as long as I can remember, there is something about the scent that is not only so soothing but it makes your skin feel like silk and makes you smell like the sweetest garden in the world.I love how I always get compliments by men and women wherever I go of how good and sweet I smell even if I forget to put some perfume on all day!I have grown accustom to the real traditional pure scent of Monoi flowers that the second I opened this up it made me sick and pretty upset to say the least for the so called &#34;Monoi&#34; scent.I will not complain about the oil freezing up because I did read it in the description prior to ordering so I was already prepared for that to happen.You must warm it up before every use so the oil can melt which does not really bother me because I always like to slightly warm my oils before massaging them into my skin because it feels so much better, but I will say that this specific oil looses its scent even more every time you heat it up.I would have definitely returned it but after warming it up, re-smelling it and going to place it on the counter the bottle just tipped over and 35% just poured out!I've used it several times since them to mix with potpourri or add a few drops in water and it has tipped over twice more which leads me to think that there is something seriously wrong with the design of the bottle since it won't stay straight the second you place down.I would never recommend this or buy it again.",3171

I'm sure that they will adjust their packaging standards for this item in the future, so it is totally worth the investment!",142

"Litter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Black",1/1,5.0,"I have 4 cats and little patience for scooping litter boxes. I've tried the automatic type with the rake - horrible! I've also tried manual shifting litter boxes. One is similar to this, but without the motor. The other required that you lift it and roll it, and inevitably, litter ended up on the floor.This is fantastic! My cats took to it pretty quickly with the help of a litter attractant. I just have one claustrophobic diva who insists on using an open litter box - and I'm okay with that.",4765

Fisher-Price Smart Cycle,1/1,4.0,"We've had this for a little over a year now (my son received this as a gift shortly before his 4th birthday), and my son still uses it.Pros:It's held up to the abuse of a 3-5 year old boy who is very energetic and active. He carries it from one place to another, climbs all over it, etc.Batteries seem to last a long time. It runs on D batteries, rather than AC. I have rechargeable D batteries, and I've only had to recharge them a few times. He doesn't play with it every day, but he does play with it a few times a week, sometimes for an hour or two at a time. Alternatively, you can get AA to D battery adapters (I have ones from Focalprice - super cheap, but work marvelously. They convert 2 AA batteries to a D - search ""2AA to D Battery Adapter Converts 2 pieces of AA battery to D battery"" on focalprice dot com). 2 AA batteries are equivalent to 1/2 D, so the batteries will run out faster, but rechargeable AA batteries are cheap and easy to get a hold of, unlike rechargeable D batteries, which are expensive.My son enjoys playing it. It's easy for him to use the controls and do what he wants to do. As he happens to like the ""racing"" games best, he ends up pedaling a lot, though the pedals have very little resistance, and the resistance is not adjustable, so I'm not sure how much exercise he's really getting even when he's pedaling a lot.The seat is adjustable, so it works for kids of various sizes.The games aren't particularly obnoxious.It comes with a very long cord to connect to the TV.It's very easy to set up and use - nothing complicated about it.The cons:It runs on D batteries with no AC option. Yes, if you know what you are doing, you can wire it to run on AC, but most people don't know how to do that. I get that it's nice to not have that extra cord, but you already have a really long cord going to the TV anyway, so why not have the option to run on batteries or AC?The games are pretty much all the same with different characters. We have the game that comes with it, Scooby Doo, Superfriends, and Cars. They look different, but they're all the same game.I don't know how it is with the newer version of this bike, but the games we have with our bike all have graphics that look straight out of the 80s. Cartridges are probably going to hold up better than whatever alternative there could be while still allowing for small kids to handle the media, but would it have really added much to the price of the bike or the cartridges to have the graphics meet Nintendo 64 levels? The bike is already the price of a cheap console, and the games are ridiculously expensive, so I assume the margins are pretty sweet for Fisher Price.There's no memory or saving of anything. You can't take a screen shot and send it anywhere. My son doesn't seem to care or notice, but it would be nice if there was some way to save preferences or save files to a memory card.Overall, none of the cons outweigh the simple fact that my son enjoys this toy, and it has some educational value, and it's not obnoxious.",963
Melissa & Doug 100-Piece Wood Blocks Set,0/0,4.0,"I ordered these colorful, wooden blocks for my toddler grandchildren. Boys and girls alike, this educational toy is a hit, and even when the kids wander away to another toy, I see that grandpa is still there building a nice tower. I would recommend this product because it is timeless, and appeals to various age groups. I'm happy with my purchase, and seemed to always be pleased when it comes from Melissa & Doug.",1998
"Crystal Radio Experiment Kit,",0/0,2.0,"The instructions are vague and outright wrong at several points. If you do not know your electronic symbols and a little about electrical circuit theory, you are going to be challenged to get this working.Certainly not something children could assemble alone as an educational aid like Crystal Radio Kits should be. But it does work once you figure everything out. Just don't expect much from an audio/tuning standpoint. This is an experiment in radio theory, not a pleasure radio. At best you may faintly hear one or two nearby stations. But, that is not the point. The point is how radio waves from miles away are able run a radio receiver with no other source of power.This is very similar to what WW2 prisoners of war created in their prisons to monitor allied radio signals. You can construct one of these the size of a cigarette pack and the only manufactured item you need is the diode. If one could sneak in a diode (the size of a 1/2&#34; piece of pencil lead), everything else can be fashioned from everyday materials. Pretty amazing!",9360

Household Essentials Hanging Cotton Canvas Laundry Hamper Bag,0/0,5.0,"I have 2 young boys and they share a room and I needed something to collect all their dirty clothes and laundry. A traditional hamper takes up valuable floor space and so I asked my husband to see what he could find. We found this bag and it looked like just what we needed. It hangs on the edge of the changing table and I love it!Pros- The hook is not in a fixed position and moves around where you can hang it to whatever angle you need.- It is made of good quality canvas with secure stitching.- It washes great! The first time I washed it I found it slides easily off the frame and though I was expecting to feeland see a difference in the canvas after a washing, I was pleasantly surprised to find I could not even tell it hadbeen through the wash!- The size is spot on. This hamper easily holds a weeks worth of laundry for my two active, messy little boys. But it isnot so big that it gets in the way or looks gaudy.- It carries easily. Even though the hook moves around, when you pick it up by the hook, the hook slides intothe locked position and the frame remains stable and it is not awkward or hard to carry around.Cons- If you are hanging the hook on a bar or rail there is the possibility that it can slide up and down.FYI",493
Remington WDF4820 Smooth and Silky Hypoallergenic Foil Women's Shaver,0/0,1.0,"My teenage daughter dropped & broke the shaver I'd had for 13 years. I thought Remington would be good -- a company known for making razors. Wrong! We've had it for about 3 months. My daughter said it didn't work as well as the old one, but I'd read it takes awhile to get used to. She's used it plenty & asked to use a regular razor, something she's been very afraid to (and still is). I tried it & I see why! It DOES NOT CUT HAIR!! One review said it was because of the trimmer before the foils, but my old one had that & worked wonderfully. I thought ""they just don't make things like hey used to,"" but took a chance yesterday & bought a $10 Conair LWD1. What a difference! It works! Remington really messed up with this one, so I'll never buy that brand again! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",9811

Matrix Biolage Ultra-Hydrating Balm 16.9 oz,0/0,1.0,"I've used this product for years. I thought I notice a change in the shampoo, seemed a bit runny. Then this last conditioner was a very obvious change in the feel. No longer creamy and thick, I'd now compare it to cheap grocery store products. I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different. This WAS the only product I had ever found that worked on my hair. Guess it's time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily. Goes back to the old adage, don't fix it if it ain't broken!!!!!! ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)",1638

He loved it so much that he took a bath with it (luckily, it stood outside the tub). It measures 36"" high so to a small child, it is almost life-like. He and his brothers love to wrestle with it and drag it around and it has maintained its shape. I would expect nothing less from a M&D product.

Miracle Coat No Fly Zone for Dogs 12 oz.,0/0,1.0,"For some reason flies have set up home base in my dog run even though I spray it down with cleaner and bleach regularly, wash my dog often and brush his coat, pick up his mess and wash away his urine daily. I've even hung fly traps but they are in mass quantities, it's frustrating. So I wanted to give my poor pup some respite and got this to spray on him and his bedding (that is washed and changed daily) but I can spray this directly on a fly and they come right back and land on his bed. I soaked his bed with it right after a washing, still flies. I've sprayed my dog thoroughly and taken minutes to brush him thoroughly to make sure its on every strand of his fur, still flies come as soon as I stop brushing him. I used the bottle up just so as not to waste it but it did not work even a tiny little bit. I wouldn't buy it.",1135

When we first got them, I tasted one and thought they tasted odd, but the kids loved them. I guess the odd taste I noticed has built up over time for them. I'll buy them again, but not for a while.

Malem Bed-Side Bedwetting Alarm with Pad,1/2,5.0,"We needed a product that did not need to be worn by our child to alert them that they were wetting. We liked that the alarm could be programmed to not only make different sounds, but it has a way to make your own recordings. We decided against the loud manufactured tones and tried a few that we recorded on our own. We were happy that we had this option. You can adjust the volume easily so that could be adjusted, too.We didn't have any problem with the pad sensing moisture and NOT sensing sweat. It took a few trials the first couple of nights to make sure that the layers of sheets on top of the pad were just right. If you only use one thin layer, the plastic pad is not comfortable to sleep on and since it is plastic, will cause sweating. I presume that is the problem that the others comment about. We found if you use a draw sheet (one sheet folded in half) on top of the pad, that it was just right. Sensed urine when it needed to and was comfortable.If you want an alarm that sits on the bed, this is a great product.",3324

It is tall, easy to put together, sturdy, and overall a great gate. I think the only feature it is missing is that it doesn't stay open on it's own, but it would depend on who you are asking (some people would prefer it close on its own instead). However, this gate never claimed to stay open on it's own so it is definitely not a fault. If I find myself in need of a gate again, I would purchase this one.",9742
"Lakota Black Spot Horse 10"" by Douglas Cuddle Toys",0/0,5.0,"Below is my original review; I loved the horse but hated the fact that the bridle/reins and saddle were sewn in & could not be removed. Actually they are only ""tacked"" in with a couple stitches which were hard to see as the threads were black on black. If you carefully use either a seam ripper or SMALL pair of scissors you can easily remove them. My daughter is having a lot of fun--both items are easy for her to remove & put back on (a huge plus for me!)This is a wonderful horse, size is exactly as described & has a wonderful expression and soft coat. The problem is with the saddle and bridle--they are NOT removable. Well, unless you cut them off. The saddle girth strap is sown into the horse's belly and the bridle is sown under the chin and throat. This is fine if the horse is just meant to sit on a shelf, but I bought this for my daughter to actually play with. When she's done with ""riding"", she likes to take everything off & brush the horse, just like a real one. I just know I'm going to end up cutting both saddle and bridle off which is really a shame--would have been very easy to just make them removable. I'm not sure if the bridle will be salvageable after cutting.",4653

Bamboo Rotating Medium Course Tooth Dog Comb (Colors Vary),0/0,5.0,"This comb is comfortable to hold, and slides easily through my mini poodle's curly fur (she has a fairy short cut at present). I like that the tines are rounded so not sharp against her skin. She seems to enjoy being combed with it. I just do a little every evening when she's chilled out in my lap.

We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry.",5032

I could sense the frustration he was having so I helped him out a little. I also became frustrated and realized I had to re-adjust my attitude because even putting the battery case together is a challenge!Then I realized that's the point - this is delicate work and much more advanced then the hardest Lego models.

Both of these don't even compare to Herbal Magic! It works the best so far...goes on well and isn't sticky, seems to cover odor very well but I'm sure if I were to workout I would need to reapply. Wish there were more scents, but the Jasmine does seem to do a good job at covering odor. It fades throughout the day too so after a couple hours it's a very mild but good smell.",7072

Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,2.0,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.",418

After covering the stovetop with Weiman's and a few minutes scrubbing, most stains are gone and our stovetop looks FANTASTIC!

Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,0/0,5.0,"Best toy purchase ever!! ...Okay, maybe not EVER, but it's pretty freakin' cool. Besides coming early, I paid close attention to where everything was. It took some digging in an old junk drawer to find a screwdriver tiny enough (good thing I've saved it for the 11th Doctor's when that comes), but after five minutes of patience and care with the batteries it paid off.I have had the best time having fun with the pen (sparingly, since I want it to last), and it actually makes a decent flashlight. This was tested during Hurricane Sandy when the power went out and my flashlight went dead. I've gotten good at flipping it and catching it like the Doctor, and sometimes I stow it in my purse for days when I'm bored.To be honest, yes, it can get tiring after a while. But I bought it over seven months ago, and the batteries still work. The lights, the sounds - they all still work! And it's the best thing a fan of David Tennant's Doctor can have. :)Now, if you excuse me, I am off to run around my room with the sonic and pretend I'm having adventures with a madman in a box.",5150

Sally Hansen Lip Inflation Sheer Pink,0/0,5.0,"This Sally Hansen Lip Inflation lip plumper works as expected, looks and feels great on, and smells wonderfully sweet. The effect of the plumper is, of course, temporary. Nothing lasts forever.It works by way of two of its ingredients, Peppermint and Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, which cause increased blood flow to the lips in effect plumping them up. It is also what causes the tingling sensation you get when you first apply the plumper.The Sheer Pink is my favorite. It is just slightly tinted and seems very natural.FYI -DIRECTIONS",7419

Inis Energy of the Sea Cologne Spray,0/0,3.0,"I was so excited to receive this Inis perfume, which I bought exclusively based on the rave reviews I saw here.Unfortunately, it isn't for me. It indeed smells very fresh and clean as other reviewers describe, however it's too heavily citrus for me and smells like a cross between the ""Coast"" and ""Irish Spring"" soaps marketed here in the U.S. Actually, I might prefer the smell of those as they are less citrus! The citrus note gets stronger the longer you have it on, too.I agree that the scent is androgenous, could definitely work for either a man or a woman. If anything, it's maybe more on the man side, but just a tad.Scent is a very individual thing, so reviews aren't the most reliable in this category. It may be the right scent for you, it just wasn't for me.",151

As he got older, he loved getting the pieces in the puzzle. The big pieces and big knobs were easy for him to do this by the time he was 1 yr old. Then as the puzzle was too easy, we used the puzzle to identify the names of each of the shapes. Excellent starter puzzle for 6 months to 3 years!",5014

China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats. Which is a little ridiculous because who has time to sit and wait for FIVE coats of nail polish to dry?! This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.,1793

Neutrogena Micro-Mist Tanning Sunless Spray,0/0,1.0,"I was not impressed. After using a variety of drugstore spray tanners, this one is by far the worst I've used. First, it smells awful, like hairspray. Second, it streaks. Third, the ""deep"" color barely showed up on my fairly pale skin (which actually worked out to my advantage, since then you could not really see the streaking, since the ""deep"" color was just barely darker than my skin). It's not worth the $11. I'm sticking with Hawaiian Topics Sunless Tanning lotion. More bang for your buck.",5087
PowerEx MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer,0/0,3.0,"Functionally, it's great. It has just about everything you'd want for charging AA or AAA batteries.The display is miserable, and why I'm knocking two stars.

MRM TribuPlex 750,0/0,5.0,"Did some reading on guys losing testosterone as they age and my hubby is 48 and I think he was feeling some of that (from listening to him describe the feeling); when he was not tired and getting his rest, he could already ""hit it like a rock star"" in the bedroom but...after trying this product, he told me he feels a BIG difference! I think it varies per person based on their t-levels and what they are taking in addition to this product (but that is just my guess); for us it's a winner! He says he feels more alive and I can certainly tell his mood is better. He seems to me to be like a younger man and we have more enjoyable conversations as a result (although that's not my favorite part...wink, wink); since I'm enjoying the bedroom activities as well being that much more fun, it's win-win for us! So, I'm on here ordering a second bottle now for him; it's only been about a month and it only took about a day or two before my guy noticed the difference (and by the way, he started off taking just one and says that 2 a day is best for him; think it is wise to start slow and then go up if your doctor says it's okay and the man feels comfortable with it)! We like this product and thank you, to the guys who reviewed it. I felt they helped my hubby decide if he wanted to give it a try and he's VERY glad he did; so am I! Signed, a very pleased, a little bit sore and truly loving it, Wifey! :)",1579

Overall not a bad experience but ill stick with more traditional brands for my black teas.,9766

Punky Color,1/1,1.0,"I ordered Lagoon Blue thinking it would be a light sky blue, like it used to be but much to my dismay, it was not even close.I applied it over a section of platinum blonde hair and thought it looked kind of crappy as soon as I started putting it on but I hoped it might rinse to a better color. No such luck. I left it for about 45 min and it rinsed to a disgusting, swampy, ugly turquoise. It looked like I had dyed it Alpine Green 4 months ago and just let it fade to this mess.I had my hair Lagoon Blue about 15 years ago and it was a perfect shade of sky blue, I don't know what went wrong.Waste of time. Waste of money.",3162
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,1/1,1.0,"The good part about this item is that it's cheap, the bad is that it is junk. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is just a plastic sheet that you are supposed to punch holes in yourself and fasten to your railing any which way you can. After struggling with this thing for about 20 minutes, I was not confident my crafty and relentless little one wouldn't just tear it up and slip through. Highly not recommended. I ended up getting a sheet of white plastic garden lattice from the local Mega-Lo-Mart, cut it to fit, and fastened with zip ties. It looks OK, and more importantly there is no way she's busting through that without X-Men powers.",2368

Traxxas 5001 Fuel Filler Bottle 500cc,0/0,2.0,"...Not a big fan of this product, this is the second one that I have bought and the first one I had I thought that maybe I overtightened the cap causing it to crack and leak.Now being on my second fuel bottle I have been very careful whith tightening the cover...yes it did last a little longer but sure enough within a month of owning it and after about 5 refills the damn thing cracked and is now no good considering the last thing you need on your fingers and on anything it touches is NITRO FUEL!! all in all I would never purchase this specific bottle again considering I already know what to expect.No I would not reccomend this specific fuel bottle to other buyers.....very cost efficient product but look forward to buying another one within a couple months ....unless you dont mind nitro fuel on your hands and whatever you set the bottle down on.",3419

Python Aquarium Replacement Pump,0/0,4.0,"This venturi valve works well with adequate water flow from the primary source. Attached to a kitchen faucet, care must be taken to place no stress on it sideways as it is plastic and will break. Metal would be preferable but apparently not available. It would also be advantageous to have the discharge threaded for a garden hose fitting (as are the suction and supply), to facilitate discharge other then to the kitchen sink or the immediate area of the venturi. Any debris plugging the discharge requires a screw be taken out to access the discharge valve which when closed acts to resupply the aquarium. Best available for the price, just be careful.",2062

Himalaya Liver Care,24/27,5.0,"Earlier this year, I went in for a routine physical and discovered my liver enzymes were all out of whack. My father died during a failed liver transplant and although his problems didn't stem from drinking alcohol I am pretty self-conscious about drinking too much and damaging my liver.After doing some research on my own and talking to my M.D., I began a regiment of LiverCare supplemented with TUDCA and Milk Thistle,TUDCA Powder (Tauroursodeoxycholic) 25 Grams + FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams.I have been taking this for the past three months, and just got new liver tests. I am in the normal range again! My ALT was 59 and now it is down to 45. I attribute this to the fact I have been taking these supplements for the past three months now and to be honest I have not done much to cut back on my drinking. Needless to say, I will continue to take these supplements.",196

Carnegie Collection- Saltasaurus,0/0,5.0,"I swear by the Carnegie Collection. Their dinosaur toys are very durable (for rough play) and wonderfully detailed, properly educating the children playing with them what these fantastic creatures really looked like. Most of the older Carnegie models are in scale with each other, which is also helpful for teaching children relative size. I mention this because this particular long neck might seem a bit small in relation to the other toys in the Carnegie line, but Saltasaurus actually was rather modestly sized compared to other dinosaurs. If you want a truly huge sauropod (long neck) dinosaur, try the Carnegie Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, or Diplodocus. That being said, there is a place in my heart for this little guy, who I've kept from when I was little myself!",7934
"Ever Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented, 25-Pound Box",0/0,5.0,"I was living with 2 cats and 1 litter box in a tiny Manhattan apartment. In desperation I asked the guy at my pet supply store (you know Sammy, who plays guitar on a stool outside the shop on warm evenings, on Christopher across from the Hangar?) what was absolutely the best litter. He pointed me straight to Ever Clean. Yes, it's expensive, and I don't know anything about the environmental impacts of clay litter. But here's how it works:It quickly absorbs all the liquid from solid waste, leaving bone-dry, aroma-free little pellets. It forms large, firm clumps of liquid waste, which scoop out easily without crumbling. Somehow the clumps always reside below the dry surface. There simply is no odor. Currently I'm in a larger home, still with 2 cats, with the box in an open area just a few feet from my TV chair. I am, I admit, not very good about cleaning the box. Yet there simply is no odor. It's amazing.In short, the only reason to buy litter this expensive is that it works much better than any other brand. And it does.",4908

Maybelline ExpertWear Brow & Eye Liner Eye Liners,0/0,5.0,"This is the best color eyeliner (medium brown) for green eyes. I am a makeup artist & have taken modeling classes. This medium brown eyeliner makes green eyes pop.

Graco Silhouette Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer,1/1,5.0,Perfect to start my newborn in! She sleeps in my room with me and a regular bassinet they grow out of so fast! So this bassinet is bigger so she can stay in longer. They changing table being connected is great to! It would of been too much for me to get up in the middle of the night and go to the baby room across the house to change her. Also I have a 2 year old that rooms right next to the baby room so the crying in the middle of the night would wake her up and that would not be good! Vibration and nature sounds are a plus also! Love the design too!,3961
Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,2.0,This was yet another of many attempts to get my medium-sized dog to stop pulling. He absolutely hated it and refused to go anywhere. It was like an episode of crocodile hunters- he was on the ground spinning and tangling in it to get it off. The part that goes over his muzzle was irritating his skin as well. I went with another no-pull leash-- the one with the hook on the chest and one strap goes under the front legs. That one works WONDERS if you can find it. This one is too difficult to get adjusted to.,7740

However, and I know this goes without saying, but make sure your baby is supervised when playing with this toy! My son was playing with it, and I was right there with him, and he put it in his mouth. Somehow he got the face of the fish wedged in his mouth, with his upper teeth in the line of the fish mouth, and his lower teeth behind the top of the fish head! It took a minute to get him unstuck, and he was pretty freaked out by it, but no harm done. He still loves the toy, and I still let him play with it.",627

Botanic Choice is probably not as good, partly because of their price but also because they add food coloring (titanium dioxide), which is totally unnecessary. Jarrow Formulas and PrimaFORCE Max are probably not as good, partly because of their prices but more because their %CLA is lower than the industry standard of 80%. The unwanted fatty acids that comprise the remaining 20% to 30% will definitely cause weight gain and may very likely also increase our risk of death from cancer.",5260
"Precious Cat Cat Attract Problem Cat Training Litter, 40 pound bag",0/1,5.0,"We have three cats. When we got the second one she used the litter box just fine to pee, but did the other in the bathtub. When we inherited the third, she stopped using it altogether, no matter how many boxes I had in the house or how often they were cleaned. We'd resigned ourselves to making her an outside kitty when I found this stuff on Amazon. It works. It works too well. Now all three cats use the one box with this specific litter in it. I've taken to just using it in all four recently. Honestly, the price isn't that bad. I was using World's Best which all the cats liked save for the problem child, but problem child didn't like any kind of litter I used sides this stuff. Whatever makes them happy makes me happy at this point and this is actually cheaper than what I was getting. I do wish Amazon had it on prime. So far, covers odor pretty well, but I clean them every time I see it needs to be done. Definitely worth trying if you have a cat that refuses to use a box. It has done wonders.",5222

DREAMATE SLEEP AID by HIVOX,0/0,5.0,"I bought this because I have had trouble sleeping and I am really a little surprised....but this thing works.It is easy to care for and if used properly, it works for me. I have found I fall asleep faster and even better yet, sleep deeper. I have also found that a couple of times during the day when I wanted to ""calm down"", I put it on and it helped with that too.I think Hivox markets this as a sea-sickness aid as well and I cannot vouch for that. I don't get sea sick but I have a friend who goes on cruises and I am actually anxious for her to try it the next time she goes.I have been using it for a few weeks and I have no rash like others have said (it states if you get a rash to discontinue use) and some people seem to say it hurts. It certainly does not hurt me. It seems to me if it hurts that a person has a REALLY low tolerance to pain. I started with it on the lowest setting and have moved it up to about the middle now.So far, I am very happy.It is not a total ""wear this once and you will sleep like a log"" but it is a device (strange as it may be) to assist you in getting better sleep.If you don't like it, I am fairly sure you could return it but I would recommend people try it out. I am sure everyone is different and maybe it won't work for you but like me, maybe it will and for $50, it has already given me, what I consider to be, it's money's worth.",9557

Many people take this just to get off blood pressure medicine and report a drop in 30pts or more- of course this is with a good diet.I always trusted the NOW brand and havent been dissapointed , we all need to look to supplements and alternatives to modern medicine cause they only provide band aids not solutionsPlease for refrence stay away from High Fructose Corn Syrup , its in many,many products- read the label people from soda, fast food,ketchup,ice cream,pickles, most sweets etc It tells the brain your not full and u keep eating and drinking more of it.Your body cant digest it and it sits on top of liver causing fatty liver disease,cirrocis,diabetes etc etc check out naturalnews dot com its a wealth of information",1513

Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest,0/0,2.0,"I ordered this product not expecting much at all and was even less impressed when it arrived. Ikea has better furniture than this.Just to make it clear, there is NO wood parts in this furniture, it is all pressed wood except for one support beam in the back. The wood feels flimsy and scratches very easy. There will be a dent if you put something heavy on top of it. I am a very handy person and it took me over 4 hours to put it together. The way the item is arranged is very disorganized and they need to learn from Ikea because I can put together Ikea Furniture in about an hour.IMHO, I would pass on this. I know the price is good and it looks decent in the picture but you can find something better. I am going to keep it only because I spent so long putting it together that I don&#8217;t want to waste another 5 hours taking it apart.",6798

Unlike some other kits I've seen, the soda ash will ensure bright colors that don't fade to pastel with one wash! Super easy to understand instructions. My only complaint...in my opinion the box saying the kit will dye up 5 t-shirts is a stretch. No way it will do 5 adult t-shirts anyway. Maybe 5 small kid sized.",949

Avalon Organics Conditioner Strenthening Peppermint -- 11 fl oz,0/1,4.0,"These types of products are great marketing schemes. My hair hasn't retreated any further, but is that due to this product? Probably not. My review is based on the actual product not its claims.I use this conditioner combined with their Biotin B complex Shampoo. I can confirm that my hair feels matty after use, thicker might be an illusion. I like the way that my hair feels after 1-2 days of use. It combs well and I literally spend 1-2 minutes messing with it to get a good look.I highly recommend cycling between the two above and something like Coconut milk Shampoo/conditioner to maintain a balance between Thick/Matted and soft/flexible. I would NOT use this shampoo daily for more than 3 days consecutively, but then again everyones hair is different. If that wasnt the case we wouldnt need thickening shampoo :)",5003

L'Oreal Excellence HiColor Red Hot 1.74 oz. Tube,0/0,3.0,"So I had done loads and loads of research on how to get my hair from dark brown to bright red (well, deep red like Ariana Grande) and this product kept popping up everywhere. It had great reviews so I decided to get it, when I realized you can't get it here in Ireland i ordered it. Now I knew a couple of people in reviews were saying that it doesnt really work on dyed brown hair but i thought, why not. My hair is naturally dark brown but i had ombre like a year ago so it has been dyed over with dark brown dye a couple of times. When I used this the first time, I can't lie I was disappointed. It made my hair red, but not vibrant enough. It really will only be bright bright if your hair is virgin hair. Nonetheless, it is a great idea and a good product, you just have to make sure its going to work. I have another box here that probably will not be used.",7377

Quantum Research Buzz Away Outdoor Spray,1/1,4.0,"I am the Ultimate Mosquito Magnet. I always say that if we were to put a hungry mosquito in a room of 1000 people, it would go straight for me. no doubt about that.the smell of Buzz Away is quite strong yet citrus-y and natural so it's no unpleasant, though whether this product this product is effective for a mosquito magnet like myself, the answer is YES and NO.Scenario 1 - YESthis handy mosquito spray is small enough to carry around with me in my purse [especially in the summer time], and it works wonderful if i'm dining outdoors with friends, gardening, or when a pesky mosquito has found its way inside the house.as long as i re-apply about every 2-3 hours, i am protected - which i believe is normal for a NATURAL product, and a small price to pay. [if you can't deal with re-applying often you might want to go the DEET route]Scenario 2 - NOi brought this spray with me camping on a florida beach, and it did NOT protect me at night. obviously i was sleeping so i couldn't re-apply the product and would wake up in the morning with bites all over, even though i had profusely sprayed myself before bed.i ended up having to switch to a DEET product at night - which is unfortunate because i'd have much preferred sleeping with a clean citrus smell in the air rather than a harmful toxic stench. but i had no choice if i wanted to avoid getting bit at night.CONCLUSION:Buzz Away works best when used for short-term exposures to mosquitos [outdoor walks, dinners, gardening..] and if re-applied every few hours for longer exposures.I would not recommend Buzz Away for night-time protection, unless you plan on waking up throughout the night to spray yourself.Hope this helps!",1019

Baby's My First Photo Album of Family & Friends,1/1,5.0,"I bought this album for my newest niece after seeing it at my friend's house. It's a great little album. I printed pictures of the family (near and far). She's 5 months old and likes looking at it, chewing it, and drooling on it. However, I am confident the pictures will be amusing later.She has two older sisters - 20 months and 3 years. The 20 month old points to the pictures, practicing her nouns (mommy, daddy, etc). She loves to look through every page over and over and studies the pictures and brings the book back over and over. She especially loves the ones she is in.The three year old loves to make up stories about each picture of her family. She tells about Auntie's last visit or the day they went to the park and took the pictures in the fallen leaves. She ""reads"" the stories to her sisters and they all enjoy it.All in all, this is a delight! It's sturdy construction makes it durable, droolable, and perfect. Each page is two clear plastic sheets sewn with fabric around the edges, so the drool doesn't reach the pictures (yet). It's not heavy enough to hurt when the baby swings it in someone face or anything, either. It was a PERFECT gift. I just need two more for the older girls now!I've also seen this book in a church nursery where the ""regulars"" and workers were featured throughout the books (there were several). I asked about them and the workers said they had held up great for over a year with several functions a week and a number of rough users.",3066
"Vetri-Science Perio-Support, 4.2 Ounce.",2/2,5.0,"A very little bit of this goes a long way so I am pleased with the price of the bottle given the amount. We mix it into the Meow Mix line of small cups of cat food that used to come in pouches since that happens to be a treat for our cats. It's a littler harder to mix into the all-natural cans that aren't as full of gravy, but if you do it when you first pop the can and then gently reheat the stuff to room temp before serving, they'll take it without giving you the ole Kitteh-Kat stink-eye! We also sometimes sneak it into tuna water for our oldest who doesn't like ""da gushy fudz"" but who needed 3 people to hold her and 2 to sedate her for her one and only teeth cleaning and still 3 people got sliced and diced! We call her our Cat-The-Ripper!This being the case, when I got the bottle, I called up my Vet and read him the ingredients over the phone. He had to do a little research and called me back reminding me that training a cat or dog from infancy to accept a pet toothbrush with poultry flavored paste is the BEST way to stay on top of tarter before it even has a chance to form into Biofilm which then hardens into tarter, he gave this product the OK as a back-up plan. Only 1 of my cats (we have 3) accepts a pet toothbrush and even then only those finger brushes you slip over your thumb. Still, he gave us his full support but asked us to ramp up our use slowly, starting with 1/4 the recommended dose and increasing that every two days and now we've been at full strength for a while. His feeling was, if you won't or they won't let you brush their teeth, anything is better than nothing so long as it's not made of harmful ingredients. There are some mushroom derivatives in here so if you have a cat with some strange allergy to edible mushrooms (and not merely fungi like ringworm that live in the ground and cause rashes on cats), show this to your vet. Mine was fine with the ingredient list, having seen the product in use with other clients plus he knows my pets very well. He's eager to see how ours respond.Perio-Support is only our second try at a preventative. Our first was with a water addative and that didn't work at all since none of the pets would drink and also we keep their water super fresh so we were wasting a lot of product. No, this powder seems to be a good fall-back. It's too soon to see any huge difference in the one cat with the beginnings of brown lines on her fangs but she eats it happily. We have seen no increase in Kitteh-Kat blorphing of food or just stomach juices which happenes with older cats, cats who sneak out and eat grass, or cats like Cat-The-Ripper who occasionally inhale too much dry food they love and forget to chew it well. In fact, we've seen a minor downturn in hairball up-chucks in Cat-The-Ripper who is a HUGE cat (not fat; just really huge for a cat) who has longer hair and therefore grooms a lot more. The Perio-support seems to be helping her out with that. All 3 cats eat the stuff if we mix it well into the can as soon as we open it, even the expensive stuff with less gravy.I'll have to come back in 6 months time and tell you if we see a difference but I'm going to keep buying just to see if the hairball reduction is a real effect. There are so MANy happy customers that I believe this stuff can work, even for Cat-The-Ripper!",4138

Nature's Life Icelandic Kelp,0/0,5.0,"To my knowledge, this is one of the lowest potency Kelp tablets available. Still, it is 225% above MRDA and for me, it's what my body needed. I eat right (mostly), don't take any prescription drugs and exercise at least 3 times a week for twenty minutes. That given, I'm still 68 years old and while I have a full head of hair (huge and really long right now) something seemed to be lacking from my - ah - focus and concentration capabilities of only a few years ago.I read about the catalyst function of Iodine in my diet and remembered that Kelp has one of the highest levels of Iodine which occurs in nature. This version served the purpose of seemingly functioning as a catalyst to get the rest of my nutrition working. I don't know if that is exclusively true or scientifically or a technically true statement - but I feel better and can create valid, if intricate sentences again. That's what I was looking for and what it achieved.The price was right - the results were better than expected.I'll buy again when I need it.",8700

She slept through most nights and the pad fit perfectly in the basinette. The shape of the sides made us feel more comfortable, because she couldn't roll over on her tummy as easily. Because of SDD you don't want your baby sleeping on their tummies.The pad has held up well. We always wrapped a light blanket around it. We also were able to just take the pad as her mobile bed when we flew into California to visit family for a week. She ""slept like a baby"" every night even though we were in a foreign place, to her.",399

AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,2.0,"I bought this brand because of all of the glowing reviews here, and I'm not happy about that decision. I wanted a light brown (not dark, like chocolate) frosting for my son's birthday cake. I didn't want to make it chocolate, and, as I said, I didn't want it very dark anyway. So, I bought the Warm Brown.I did a test run of his cake today. I made my frosting and added in a couple of drops of the paste. It was basically pink. Well, brownish-pink, but way too pink. I thought that maybe I needed more to get closer to the color on the sticker that is on the cap. So, I added some more. Still too pink. So I added still more. By the time I had finished, it was slightly more brown, but still had way too much of a pink undertone for what I was looking for. And it really wasn't close to the colored sticker on the bottle.I'm pretty disappointed. Perhaps it is just this brown color that is the problem and that the others are great. But, the Wilton colors I have so far have met my expectations much better than this. I am glad that I did a trial run on the birthday cake. I think that I will have to go for chocolate frosting after all, using cocoa to get the color I want.",3899

Playmobil Security Check Point,58/59,3.0,"Generally, this is a good product for teaching children to obey people who say you should obey them, which of course is how to be a good citizen and everybody knows it.Unfortunately, the plastic is a lower grade than it should be. When my daughter was unable to make one of the terrorist passengers confess and applied a heated piece of coat hanger wire to the terrorist traveler's face, instead of divulging the lies he was withholding, his face melted. Very disappointing given the strength of other plastics on the market. If we are going to use this as a teaching tool, we need to think in terms of the future here.We also quickly became aware that the nice security agents needs to give out audible voice commands to help children learn the cues for future submissive behavior. For example, when the TSA agent gropes the old lady in the extended pack, he should shout, ""Either you do it, or I will have you arrested! Do you want to fly to see your children or spend tonight in a cold cement jail cell?!!""There were other areas lacking realism, but that one seems an easy fix for later upgrades now that batteries have gotten smaller and speaking dolls are common.I'd also have preferred not to pay so much extra just to get the working handcuffs and the holding cell for the traveling terrorists our children help apprehend to make the collective better.",7358

Small World Express Egg-Shape Sorter,0/0,4.0,"I bought this for my 2 year old son to go in his play kitchen - i thought the extra educational value of the shapes and colors, also practicing his dexterity would be a great plus. I was also looking for a set with a carton that would be durable and last (plastic not the cardboard kind). With these expectations I am very satisfied with this purchase. The carton is a little plain but cute and should hold up over time, even the little tab that keeps it closed. The egs each have a different shape and color on the inside, they all come apart easily but stay together pretty well too, my son is able to do them all and gets lots of enjoyment from doing it himself, in fact no one but him can touch these eggs! He also has fun taking them out and putting them back in the case.one reviewer said if you put the fat side down it will get really stuck, I've tried it and found it does get tight and does fit better skinny side down but we haven't had a problem of them getting stuck yet. I gave four instead of five stars because the quality could be a little better, but I think it will last many many years. I would recommend this to anyone with a play kitchen and looking for fun food to go in it, or if your looking for the educational value this is a great little toy also.",7754

Vitamin C Crystals Ascorbic Acid 100% Pure Powder,3/4,4.0,"Hello friends!! I am writing a review which I rarely do even though I buy on Amazon quite a bit. Currently I am on day 29 0f 40 Day Water Fast!! This is by far the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life!!! The reason I say that is because of the long list of detox symptoms that come along with it, the worst one being absolutely NO ENERGY to do even the simplest tasks. I have done Vitamin C Flushes in the past and decided that this would be a great time to incorporate it into my water detox fast. It worked out perfectly! During the fast I have done a total of 11 days of Vitamin C flushes and have seen MASS amounts of built up mucus and toxins just pour out of my Lymphatic system!!! So often society is guided into thinking that ""changing your diet and exercise"" will net you a healthier life. While that may be ""half"" true, we forget that when we lived a TOXIC LIFESTYLE, that all of the toxins that we have ingested are permanently lodged inside of our tissues. We have to flush these out by some sort of means and it is by my personal experience that I believe that long water fasts and vitamin c flushes are the only way. The first couple of flushes netted me thick pasty like mucus out of the rectum. As I continued the flushes, I noticed less and less mucus that resembled more of a ""shrapnel"" consistency. This product definitely works if you are in the market for purchasing it for the purpose of Vitamin C Flushes. I should have bought a smaller jar as I do not see myself needing the product for the remanding duration of the fast. I would have given it five stars but the only thing I didn't like about it is the unpredictability of passing a mucus flush after it is ingested which can last for up to two days, but all Ascorbic Acid does that.",218

Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple,0/0,5.0,"This is a pretty basic, no-frills nipple. It fits in the caps on the Gerber BPA free bottles, as well as those rings that come with the tiny disposable formula bottles you get at the hospital or from the doctor. It is x-cut so the flow is pretty quick; however, we needed something with a larger hole because my son would not suck long when he had an ear infection. He was not getting enough calories so the doctor (off the record) recommended putting a bit of rice in the bottle with the breastmilk to boost his calorie intake and to get him to take more ounces in a shorter period of time. His other nipples were clogging- typically he takes a medium flow at 21 weeks old. This is the perfect flow for getting him thicker fluids. The medium is best for just breastmilk at this age. Also, we have used MAM, Born Free, Milkbank, and Dr. Browns with all of our kids and the Evenflo, as well as the similar Gerber style, is his favorite.",2529

"Parker Spectra 360 Electrode Gel, Clear Tube with Stand-Up Cap",0/0,5.0,"Bought a heart rate monitor and figured I could get away with simply using water on the sensors to help with the readings, but obviously water rolls off quite quickly and easily, so I decided to purchase this electrode gel to help get a better reading.I use an amount about the size of my pinky fingernail on the sensors. The gel is thick enough that it stays put, but not so thick that it feels like you've got paste on yourself. I like that it stays put on the sensors far better than plain water does, and it has improved the ability of the HRM to keep giving me a reading vs. plain water, which would give me intermittent readings.Given the amount that I need to use (pinky fingernail's worth), this 8.5 oz tube seems like it'll last several months, if not closer to a year!There's very little odor to this, and what odor I do notice reminds me of hand sanitizer or something similarly non-offensive. Regardless, with the miniscule amount you need to use, there should be no issue with the smell.",4699
China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"I love, love, love this color for the summer time! It shows off your tan really well and is a nice neon without being unattractively bright.

Even after using a base coat and Seche Vite, I still have a problem with it chipping after a few days. I've had this problem with every neon I've ever owned, so I don't know if it's something to do with the color, but it is frustrating.

Zillionz Talking Cash Register,1/1,1.0,"I was super excited to order this cash register for my two children ages 4 and 5, however, I was quickly disappointed when I realized I had received a piece of junk. The first cash register never turned off so the batteries died after about 3 days of playing with it, maybe a total of 20 minutes. I returned it to Amazon (wonderful customer service) and they sent me another one very quickly, only to learn that the second one was the same way. Now we have a cash register (second one) with no sound. This would typically be fine with me except that I paid $30 for this toy expecting a quality toy that would help my children learn about money, number recognition, etc. I normally do not read reviews before buying a toy, but please heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS TOY unless you are ok with it not working properly and are prepared to have very disappointed children (AND parents!).",3271

My second impression was sensory - it didn't smell as strong or as good upon opening the package. Still, I soldiered on an steeped my family a pot of this new rose bud tea. Everybody had the same reaction - it didn't have as much of the delicate rose flavor and did not taste the same as the original tea we used earlier in the year. The package says &#34;from China&#34;, but even though it is packaged in the same country of origin, the material used is not the top grade.",8726

It is the only Lip protection any of us will use. We have tried may other products but this is the one they all want. Light cherry flavor and is as smooth as silk when on.

Jason Body Care Satin Shower Body Wash,1/1,2.0,"This body wash has a really faint, almost non-existent Tea Tree scent. I own a hand soap by Jason and it is scented just right, smells great and the scent is very potent.The bodywash lathers well, like all Jason products and has a smooth feel to it, but it almost feels unscented in its neutral representation of Tea Tree.If you were using it, you would not even know that is not unscented. So if you are looking for tea tree oil minty scent and, perhaps, anti-fungal effects, look somewhere else. This bodywash fails to deliver the promised kick.",1316
"Fluidmaster 8302 Flush Sparkle Bleach Replacement Cartridge, 2 Pack",0/0,4.0,I bought three of the chlorine clean and sparkle units (not be confused with the blue die units). All work well and we are pleased with the cleaning they do. I did need to modify the fill tube attachment on each one. On the 50 year old Eljer toilets there is no center fill tube. The fill tube is molded into the back of the tank. I made a mistake I made years ago. I left the tube full length and it slowly siphoned the water out acting just like a leak. After spending a couple of frustrating days and various replacements for the flush system I realized that there was no leak but rather a siphon. I even remembered that all this happened once before. I cut the tube length so that it was above the water level. Everything has worked fine since. On the one new toilet the fill tube on the Fuidmaster dual flush replacement I installed did not allow for the supplied attachment system to connect to the shouldered tube. It was easy enough to buy a brass tube and solder on a modified brass bar from the discarded flush handle thereby making an idea attachment system. My only concern is that the cast iron hub sewer pipe will eventually be negatively affected by the continual exposure to the strong oxidizing of the chlorine treatment.,900
Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,1/1,4.0,"We had one of the original Drinkwell fountains and the cats loved it. My big cat loved drinking from the stream.

Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord,0/0,3.0,"Worked great until it didn't... I liked the retractable cord for ease of storage, but was disappointed that one morning (without any warning signs) it just didn't work! I blow dry 3-4 x wk for just a couple of minutes each time (I have really thin hair), so this hairdryer was not ""overworked""... Compared to my past dryer that lasted 10 yrs, I'd say this one was not the best quality, but it's also not super expensive, so the buyer will have to weigh the cost vs. the quality...",1470
Desert Essence - Tea Tree Oil & Neem Toothpaste,0/0,5.0,"This is my absolute, all-time favorite toothpaste. Not only is it natural and good for you, but it leaves a wonderful taste of fennel in your mouth. I can't seem to find this flavor in the stores in my area. A little pricier than other name brands, but it is so worth it. Other toothpaste brands make me gag when I first wake up, but I look forward to this one. I usually buy several at a time to reduce shipping costs.",5787

Angel By Thierry Mugler For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray Refill 3.4 Ounces,4/4,1.0,"Received item in a timely manner. But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper. When I opened the wrap the box said "" tester"" . Ive ordered this product a minimum of 5 xs and never seen it wrapped. It has always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors. Then I looked at the color. Its not as blue as the real Angel. I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and the difference in color is very noticeable. Now the scent. Watered down. The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity. This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes. Im very unsatisfied and now I know to purchase from my reliable vendor for Angel. Thought I was getting a deal but got hosed.",1112

Within 12 hours, the 6700K bulb stopped lighting up. Amazon replaced it. The 6700K bulb on the replacement unit blew within 24-48 hours of use. Total garbage. Apparently this model (T5NO) has known issues and is no longer being manufactured. If this model is defective, then why is this item even being sold on Amazon?",1935

I usually put it on troubled areas every other night, and I've had few breakouts since I started to use this. Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor (Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure), this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I've had without having a prescription.

Coverlet Adhesive Bandage 2 Inches X 3 Inches - 50 per box,0/0,3.0,"Hypoallergenic and 'latex free' are two different things- I am allergic to the adhesive on the tape- our local drug store was out of the hypoallergenic bandaids so I bought these on line as I was running out while dealing with a wound-- sadly, I can not use them, even though I need them urgently, I will have to drive around tomorrow to find bandaids that I can use without my skin falling off.The box looked like someone re-taped it shut after being opened...They are probably good bandaids, but the description needs to clearly state that they are latex free vs. hypoallergenic.",8272

Aloe life Skin Gel - 8 oz - Liquid,0/0,5.0,This gel was exactly what I wanted. Aloe without a bunch of chemical crap in it. I use it as a face moisturizer after showering. I hate putting lotion or anything oily on my face but do need a moisturizer and this fits the bill perfectly. A little goes a long way and this stuff does NOT flake unless you use too much or do multiple layers. I know this because I've reapplied every couple hours on a healing area from removing a mole and this is when you experience flaking... not from one layer of covering your face. It really makes my face feel healthy and tight. It dries really fast and the smell that is not great disappears before you know it. I'm anxious to see what becomes of the area where the dermatologist sliced me but it's too soon right now to say. I'll have to report back!,7655

Naturtint Permanent Golden Blonde 7G 2 Ounces,2/2,3.0,"While Naturtint does not damage my hair as much as other colorants, I would not say it is the best. It does damage it a bit and every time I use it I notice more breakage. The color washes out fairly quickly and it is a lighter color than pictured after a few washes. When I first dyed it, it looked very ashy and was not what I was looking for. I will keep looking for a better product that will cause less damage.",1034

Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion 2.2 Oz & Peel System Skin Care 2.0 Fl Oz,68/69,4.0,"Olay knows how to make skin care products. The peel does precisely what it's intended to do. It clears my face, gives me a fresh look. I'm thrilled right after I take it off. But it's a chemical peel- by the next day, I feel dry. The product works, it really does, but it doesn't provide enough moisture for my skin to keep it glowing after the peel process settles. The solution to that problem? I tried all kinds of creams- they left me feeling heavy. My friend recommended a retinol cream which I fell in love with -. I like to keep as light and natural as possible, and it seems to do the trick. There are tons of options out there but if you're like me and you like to go 100% natural, then here's my suggestion:Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set. Its a thick cream but still absorbs really good so I'm not constantly reapplying. It keeps my skin healthy and glowing after using the peel and each day until I decide to peel again. I'm not flaky or strained anymore after using it. My hands don't get greasy and my pores aren't clogged either.",5266
"New-Skin Liquid Bandage, First Aid Liquid Antiseptic, Over 50 Applications, 0.3 Fluid Ounce",3/3,5.0,"***This is not a scientific study, all evidence presented is anecdotal. ***I have now used New Skin twice on relatively large burns and abrasions with amazing results. Once was road rash after a bicycle race (~ 6 square inches over three wounds). The second was second and third degree burns from a camp fire (~ 4 square inches in two wounds).The road rash healed with almost no scarring, despite being deep enough to burn through the skin and subcutaneous fat.The burns are currently doing well, though it has only been a week and they have not healed completely.I have not been able to find many details about using New Skin on wounds this large. I don't know if it is safe, or even a good idea, but it seems to work.I have used both the spray and the brush applicator form of this product. The spray form is much easier to use and the liquid form is cheaper per application.In both cases, I did not apply New Skin for hours or days after the injury occurred. When applying I cleaned the wound with an aniceptic wash and allowed it to air dry. After it was dry I applied an even coat over the entire area and a 5-10mm border around the wound. It formed an artificial scab. I reapplied twice a day to fill in cracks and maintain the border. If you reapply a full coat each time you end up with a huge accumulation after a few weeks (1-3mm).The artificial scabs are transparent, so you ( and everyone around you if you're lucky enough to wound your hand) will be delighted with a view of what I believe is a mixture of plasma, platelets and blood. It looks like puss, but I think it's the liquid that dries to form real scabs (sometimes I spring a leak and it dries into a scab). IF THE WOUND BEGINS TO SWELL, FEEL HOT OR BECOME RED IT MIGHT BE INFECTED.",6300
Nicoderm Cq Nicoderm Cq Step 1 Clear Patches,0/0,4.0,"With the 7- and 14-mg patches there was no problem getting them to adhere, but with the larger patches I found myself relying on Band-aids to keep them on throughout the day.

LABRADA NUTRITION Lean Body Meal Replacement Formula,0/0,3.0,I've been using Lean Body Shakes for a while now. They've always tasted great but this last shipment tasted chalky and was quite difficult to drink.

Boundaries,2/4,1.0,"I realized this is a book for Christians and it's theories are based on the bible when I picked up two copies for me and my mother to read. We both struggle with healthy boundaries in the workplace and at home. She is a devout catholic and I am an agnostic. I thought it was very interesting how we both ended up hating this book. Using the myth of creation, the story of Adam and Eve, to justify why we take on too much as individuals is asinine. We live in a society that pushes us to be perfect. Even my mother felt that the book was base, silly, and misleading, using biblical quotes loosely and taking many things out of context. The bible is the ONLY book referenced throughout the entire text. In a literate society, you'd think the authors would realize Christians read more than just the bible. With all of the popular literature on social science, health and psychology, they could use something other than an ancient text of myths, legends, and poetry to guide individuals who are struggling with REAL PROBLEMS and REAL RELATIONSHIPS in the REAL WORLD. Instead they rely on the power of old words like ""sin"", ""evil"", ""Satan"", and dangerous notion that boundary issues are a ""Christian"" problem, and thus should be solved strictly in a ""Christian"" form and fashion.",9079

He has had a hyper-thyroid condition for most of his adult life and has been medicated with 2 1/2 mg. of methimazole for about 10 years. The epakitin supplement is sprinkled on his food twice a day. I have been using it about 4 1/2 months and he seems to feel good and is active for such an old fellow. Best of all, he likes it and I have no problems at all getting him to take it with food. Cats are often very difficult when it comes to any kind of meds so I am grateful for the ease of dispensing. Also buying this supplement through Amazon is MUCH cheaper than anywhere else I have discovered. Very happy about that.",3389
Johnson & Johnson Johnsons Baby Oil Gel With Aloe Vitamin E,1/1,1.0,"I had really high hopes for this product because I have used J&J skincare products my whole life and have used them on all 4 of my children, with great results. HOWEVER, within 60-90 minutes of applying the baby oil gel to my legs, arms and chest, I broke out in a horrible rash in these areas. 48 hours and two showers later, the rash is still there, still itching like crazy. It is beyond annoying. I have never had any kind of allergic reaction to any skin lotion/oil product so this is an unexpected outcome. I'm sure lots of people won't have any problem with this product. That said, I highly recommend patch testing this on a small area before using it all over your body or using it on small children. Also, the product instructions say that using it on wet skin is more effective than on dry skin. Well, my rash is most definitely worse where my skin was wet...probably because it soaked into my skin more deeply. Super.",7748

I have tried Essie Ballet Slippers and Essie Mademoiselle, but found them to be just a bit lighter than what I wanted and it also took at least four coats to produce the desired result. Who has time for that? Two coats of Delicacy covers well; three is better followed by Essie topcoat. My nails look neat, finished and not bare but they don't scream ""I've been polished"" either. The polish has just enough pink to give definition with a very slight pearl appearance. It's a perfect shade for me.",2380
"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"Love, love, love this for my kitten and he likes it too! It's easy to clean, all you have to do is roll it and it sifts out all the kitty waste. It takes a few times to get the hang of it, but really I don't know why anyone would dislike it. I can see how it could maybe break easily, like with the clips that hold the top on it, but honestly if you are careful with it and use it the right way you should have no problem. As it says on the directions to use clumping litter, for our kitty we use Arm & Hammer Double Duty, this litter combined with the litter box is excellent. People don't realize we even have a cat, we never smell it. I am so glad we have it! :-)",2614

FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,5.0,"Our groomer recommended this for our two dogs but since they were so expensive, she recommended a knock-off.

CitiKitty Cat Toilet Training Kit,0/0,1.0,"Be prepared for a mess on your floor! And if you have tile floors around your toilet, be extra cautious! I followed the direction to a T. I had 2 cats that I was trying to train. They seemed to do ok when there was no hole in the tray. As soon as a hole appeared, one of them freaked out and started going to the bathroom (pee and poo) on the floor. I gave them a lot of time without a hole too. Be aware that when you first start, the cat will probably want to put all four paws on the tray with the litter. And since they've squeezed all four paws into such a tiny space, where does their back end wind up? You guessed it - perched over the seat! So... I hate to paint a picture here, but since their rear-end is over the seat, the pee goes onto the seat, drips all over the toilet and onto the floor! I eventually had to give up on this thing after a number of weeks. I couldn't even make it to the first hole with one of my cats. My cats were miserable and then I had to regrout the bathroom floor because NOTHING (no chemicals, bleach, Nature's Miracle, etc) could take the stain or stink out of the grout.",9089

"Lipton Flavored Black Tea, Spiced Chai, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This is my favorite tea and since it was no longer available in grocery stores, I began ordering it from various sellers through Amazon. I just bought 6 boxes of 20 at the ridiculous price of $46, BUT NO MORE!! For those of you who also love this tea, there is great news. Lipton has a Spiced Cinnamon Chai tea that has all but one of the same ingredients of the former Spiced Chai. So do your self a favor, keep some of your pennies in your pocket and get the same taste with Liptons Spiced Cinnamon Chai. Now this same vendor I purchased 6 boxes from is selling it for $56.00 taking advantage of the fact that we love this tea. Go back to your local grocery stores and purchase the Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai so that these won't also disappear from the shelves.",2022

OTC ORTHOTEX Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Spiral Stays,0/0,2.0,This item had to be exchanged for larger size. Once i got the larger size it slipped after 20 steps just like it says on the damn review.

"Replogle Globes Traveler Globe, 12-Inch, Blue",0/0,4.0,"This seems like a great globe for the price. As prior reviewers mention, the stand is made of plastic, and does flex a little under use. However, we haven't had any problems with it with our preschoolers.If you're looking for an old-school globe with wooden base and metal stand, don't expect to find one for the same price. However, if you're looking for a good, basic globe with raised relief, this one definitely meets the need.",3387

Clif Kid ZBar,0/0,5.0,"Other reviewers have said great things both about the Clif Kid Zbars in chocolate chip and about the entire company. All I want to add is that my toddler LOVES these. He will eat one, then ask for more. I am so glad that there is a healthier snack option out there to compete with cookies. And I don't feel too guilty giving him a ""bar"" snack on days when he refuses breakfast. Though smaller than Clif bars, they do seem large for a toddler. But great for kids. I often snack on them too. Just because my toddler eats them, don't assume that they are small.",1426

They all loved it and at least one parent asked me where I found itI would highly recommend this to anyone with kids.

Gy-Na-Tren Oral/Vaginal Kit 14 Day Supply New & Improved - 1 - Kit,0/0,5.0,"This product was a last resort for me prior to seeing a doctor, who most likely would have prescribed antibiotics. I had been dealing with bacterial vaginosis for several weeks and had tried hydrogen peroxide douches (which evidently has worked for many women) as well as another product, femdophilus. Nothing had worked for me yet. And at first, I did not think this product was working either. It is supposed to be taken regularly for 14 days, and the two weeks was almost up before my symptoms ceased. But the symptoms did go away by the time the 14 days was finished. That was about two months ago, and the infection has not returned.I was hesitant about the effectiveness of the product simply because I ordered it. I've read on the web that the heat a product like this might be exposed to during shipping might damage its effectiveness (and I placed this order in August!). But the product worked nevertheless.",1831

Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet Fountain,1/1,1.0,"Unlike other reviewers, my cats loved this fountain. I have three, and the fountain did a good job. I only put filtered water into the unit, and I cleaned it weekly.However, this week, my catsitter noticed that the motor had stopped. She unplugged the unit. I came home and thought it might just need cleaning. I discovered that the motor housing had melted. The spinning plastic bit of the motor had fused to the unit.Thank goodness my cat sitter unplugged it. I can't imagine what might have happened if she hadn't.Of course, anyone that has used a fountain knows that once your pets get used to it, they won't drink water any other way. Luckily Petsmart had a stainless steel 360 available. It is a similar motor but smaller. I've used the plastic ones previously. Anyways, I won't go back to the big dog unit after seeing what happened with the motor housing.",634

But this aftershave balm certainly does the trick. I have not had a problem with razor burn in months since I started using this product.

Travels Light Hot Air Balloon,1/1,5.0,"I bought the Green, Blue and Rainbow balloons for my 2 year old sons room where they hang from the ceiling in front of his 6' wide window. They are very well made and of high quality. The main balloon / orb is hard plastic and quite durable. My son dropped and kicked one the day they arrived without any damage. I had originally been looking at the larger models but due to their cost I decided on these and quite happy that I did! They look great in his room with a few white clouds on the ceiling over them, vintage airplanes on the walls and a few vintage model planes planned down the road. He enjoys looking over at them at night when going to bed and throughout the day points up saying balloons and fly and their colors now as well.Again these are very nice, high quality models that will not disappoint. If your looking and thinking of buying them just hit the purchase button and checkout. Enjoy!",6504

Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Orange Sencha Tea,0/0,5.0,"My local grocery doesn't carry the organic orange sencha green tea, but does carry several other flavors of Two Leaves and a Bud. If I want to order this flavor from my grocery, I have to purchase an entire case. The flavor is mild green tea with a light citrus blend. It's wonderful. I quit drinking coffee this year, and only drink green tea. I've tried several different varieties, but Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Orange Sencha Green Tea is still my favorite. Great price for a wonderful tea.",4591

Avalon Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"I decided to try one of the natural shampoos after moving to the city (DC) and trying to lessen my exposure to chemicals. I work in a biotech lab and use alot of the chemicals found in normal shampoo on a daily basis. I decided I just didn't need such harsh surfactants (SLS) and cleating agents (EDTA, etc) when all I was trying to do was wash off some sebum. I am a particularly sweaty person and this shampoo cuts through the grease in my medium length hair no problem and has a sweet mango scent. Gets a good lather, smells good, organic and not tested on animals (which is just a bonus to me), less chemicals what more could you ask for?",84

Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard,0/0,5.0,"We have a 2008 home one screw outlets. These fit great -- they cover the entire area that the old outlet covers did (no worries about touch-up painting needed) and the little covers slide smoothly (but not do easy that my child could move them).I was worried that big plugs might fall out of this, but so far the only time a plug has fallen out was when the vacuum cleaner cord was plugged in and the cord was stretched too far.These look nice - they do not look like you baby proofed your house. And, they eliminate the need for plug covers that could become choking hazards if your child was able to pull these out (we have exclusively these in my child's room for that reason).",7004
JOVAN MUSK For Women By COTY Cologne Spray,0/0,3.0,"I had no idea what this smelled like. I bought it just hoping it would smell nice. I was just satisfied with it.

Cottonelle Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes Travel Pack,0/0,2.0,"The product itself is fine, but for whatever reason, it was really difficult to pull one individual wipe out of the packet. It didn't seem like the outside edge of each wipe was centered so as to be able to easily access it through the opening in the middle of the packaging. That opening is fairly small, too, so it was hard to dig around in there to pull out one wipe. I wound up tearing the top wipe trying to separate it from the one underneath it. I wanted to get this to have a travel pack, but one that was more environmentally sound than individually wrapped wipes, but I wouldn't buy this particular product again.",9912

Jarrow Formulas Inositol Powder,4/4,5.0,"I am so glad I found this Inositol! I have been taking it for a month and a half and will now never live without it. And Jarrow products are of high quality.As a former java junkie I have likely depleted stores of it in my liver; I probably was deficient in it to begin with. While I thought I ate healthfully I didn't get enough fiber and Inositol is found there.I researched it and found it is supposed to help with Type 2 Diabetes, ADD, ADHD, OCD and SAD. It is important in helping your liver burn fat and blood sugar and remove it from the blood stream. If your liver can't burn fat or handle sugar effectively, then cholesterol starts to accumulate in your body. I have problems with most all these issues. A doc told me I was PCOS ""light"".The biggest boon was to my mood. After a few days of starting it (slowly @ 1/4t increased to ~ 2t a day). I used to be moody and irritable. I noticed at about day 4 my husband and I got into a fight about an oft fought 'bout topic. Normally it would escalate with me being the hotter of the two. This time I was totally cool. I was rational! And the hubby later had to say sorry. That was nice for a change.I think the powder is a nicer form to take it. It mixes easily in water and anything that helps me drink more water the better. Tastes lightly sweet too.I give this to my husband who still likes to drink too much coffee.I hope this helps.",3579

Everlasting Treat Ball,1/1,5.0,"I love this treat ball, however, do not bother putting the treat disks in the outer slots as shown in the picture. Your smart dog will chomp them right out and eat them promptly. If you put the treat disk, or any type of treat, really, in the MIDDLE compartment... this will keep your dog entertained for HOURS AND HOURS. My German Shepherd chewed at this for many hours, licking and chewing until he finally gave up exhausted and sleeping with the ball still in his paws. The Bernese Mtn Dog got hold of a Medium size ball (he should have a large) and managed to rip it apart to get to the inner area filled with treats. One expensive dog ball, destroyed. However, this was not the right size for him, so perhaps that's why. The Coton de Tulears that I gave the small size ball to have still not finished the treat. They've been licking and chewing for 2 days now. So overall, I love this product, as long as you DON'T use it the way it's shown! :)",5073

Body Back Buddy & Mini-BBB Self Massage Tool Duo,0/0,4.0,"The big S shaped device is good for getting to some places on the back, but the knobs are often too small and hard (ouch). I wish they offered little balls that could be fitted over the knobs. I guess I'll have to retrofit them myself. I had one of these type things years ago, and it was the same problem. I put a tennis ball over the knobs and it was great. So, it still gets 4 stars because it's a good contraption for the purpose.The little hand-hook, which hitchhiked with my order of the big S, is a disappointment. The knob has a gnarl on the end that is just not right. I might file that gnarly thing off, which would make it more practical. It's not good for much of anything except someone with a tiny waist. However, I do think it will be useful for the neck area, once I file off that gnarl or fit it with a ball.So, I took off a star because of the above issues, which are relatively insignificant. Nevertheless, I wanted to mention them to help consumers who are considering the device, or as suggestions for the maker of these devices, if they ever read these Amazon reviews.",3363
Youngblood Loose Mineral Foundation,0/0,5.0,"This mineral makeup is, by far, THE best on the market. The coverage is exceptional. The first time I came across it was at my hair salon. My young stylist used it, and she was living proof. Her skin and makeup always looked flawless, so I decided to give it a try. Being 'older', I was a bit reluctant, thinking it would make my skin look dry. Not at all. It covered up all my imperfections without having a caked on look. It's like magic. Any pigmentation, freckles, unevenness in tone, all vanish with Youngblood. It works exceptionally well at covering up ACNE so much so that my SON used to ask me to apply it to his face before he went off to school. I once went in to my local spa, walked over to the makeup counter to see if they had any of this type, and they didn't. When the woman at the desk asked if I needed any help, I started to explain that I was looking for a certain type of mineral makeup that they didn't have, and how much I thought it was the best on the market, without giving her the brand name.She then said 'is it youngblood?&#34;.. I thought i'd die! I immediately responded by saying a big YES! She said, &#34;I know, but we don't sell it here&#34;. I looked everywhere in my area, and couldn't find...so I tried Amazon, and sure enough, they have it!!!!!",7327

I used to use tampons, but would have to wear a liner along with it because I would leak all the time even after only an hour's use. With the Diva Cup, I have never had a leak. Yes, you have to get over the whole &#34;Ew I'm touching blood from my vagina&#34; but honestly, you don't get that grossed out by snot do you? Same concept. Every woman should have one of these. They're easy to use, easy to clean, saves you money, and is good for the environment. I really don't see a downside to this wonderful product.",9595

White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,"Yes, I am giving 4 stars to the product itself because it deserves it. But Never again will I buy perfumes online. This is the 4th bottle that is now sitting on my dresser, useless. Bought from different online companies. Not just Amazon.Fragrances bought online DO NOT smell anything like the ones bought in store. Why? I have no clue. But that has been my sad experience for the last few months. Disappointment after disappointment. Money and time spent and lost.Yes, it is cheaper than buying in store, but the trade off just isn't worth it for me. All the money wasted on 4 bottles would have been sufficient for one at the store that I wouldn't be disappointed with.If you've never used a fragrance before buying it online, you probably won't notice the difference. But If you have, as I have been, using White Diamonds for years, this has been such a headache! It just does not smell the same as the one bought in store. Period.",9700

"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,4.0,"I got these to get that movie theater quality popcorn taste and boy does it come close. I love that the ingredients are included in the single pack, instead of having to purchase oil and popcorn separately. I did add Flavacol and Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping as well to get even closer to that movie theater taste.I cook mine in a Whirley Pop and it works well. I think to get true movie theater flavor you have to cook it in a true popcorn popper with the kettle that dumps the popcorn right after popping it. I think that on the stove you lose some flavor as the popcorn stays in the kettle and is subject to additional heat and moisture after it pops.All in all the packaging is nice and easy to use. I just wish they had an easier tear option at the top. Usually I cut open the oil side with scissors and dump it in the Whirley Pop first to melt it. Then I cut open the remainder of the package and dump the contents in when the temp is good. Generally I get a consistent batch, but every now and then I get a batch that is either too crunchy or a little too sticky. I am not sure if that is the fault of this product or my cooking methods.",3460
Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden,0/0,1.0,This is a horrible company!! This product does not cost $14.88. All you get for this price is a large fabric bag. You have to contact the company for the butterflies (caterpillers) and when you do they tell you it is going to cost another $5. That brings the price up to $20 not what is advertised.,4051

JJ Cole Essentials Blanket,2/2,5.0,"This item was EXACTLY as described. My friend had one of these all purpose blankets. When I saw hers, I had to know where she had gotten hers. Every time the family and I went on an outing, I always wished I had brought something to sit on and not just a traditional blanket, but something sturdier and waterproof. This is it!!!I have to write, I was a little nervous after having read some of the reviews. I think that the J.J. Cole company really cares about their product and their consumers because all of the issues that had people had written about were none issues. This product did not smell like a petroleum product at all. I have one of the most sensitive noses around. I can't handle the smell of perfumes or non-natural based cleaning products. I'm telling you not a problem. I stuck my nose all over this product! Lol. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I couldn't smell anything. I also have a seven month old baby, so I was concerned about him crawling on something that could be toxic. Again, non-issue. Didn't have to wash it or air it out.The strap. Sewn on well. Hasn't broken yet. We shall see how that pans out. Also, there is an outer pocket. Would be nice if it had a flap on it to keep things from, potentially, falling out. This hasn't happened to me, but I could see if you were swinging it around where small things could fall out. It is a rather deep pocket that would fit several diapers and a small travel case of wipes without a problem. Of course, once you got to where you were going you would need to take items out to flatten the blanket out anyway. The pocket is strictly to hold a few things until you get where you are going.Velcro closure, yes, stuff could get stuck in it if you weren't careful about unfolding. There is a way that the Velcro folds up against the material so that debris, leaves, etc., doesn't get all stuck. Also, do be careful, if you are wearing something delicate like silk, the Velcro could stick and snag delicate clothing. I had on a casual silk sweater and when I was trying to fold it up, I had to be very careful not to snag it, but it could snag up a swimsuit when trying to fold it up. This DID NOT occur when I was sitting on it, as the Velcro is underneath the mat.Color of mat, mine was called grey and red. This is referring to the color of the trim and the exterior material, not the interior pattern. So, if you order gray/green, it means the exterior is gray and the trim is green. I was a bit surprised that other reviewers hadn't figured that out.Size is roomy. Five foot by five foot. Perfect to sit on or eat a picnic on. Yes, if you are trying to seat a small village you will need two or more. I actually have a small village, myself, hubby, and four kids, and we were fine. I kept reading how people think it's too small, not to be rude, but I think they might just have more girth than others. It's plenty roomy for trimmer people. I wasn't sure how else to word that in a politically correct fashion. Please don't shoot the messenger.Overall, love my product!!! Was exactly what I had been looking for.",1325

"KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Toy",2/2,3.0,"My results with this 'brush' is that it moves fur around much as if massaging by hand. What hair does stick to the brush is difficult to remove, as it's sort of stuck on the material. During baths, it seems my hand does a better job of massaging the shampoo in, and the hair that comes off the dog gets stuck in the drain strainer rather than on the brush where it's a pain to remove. Was hoping it would at least have some effect on my little terrier, but it seems I get more loose fur by just rubbing my hands around and then brushing.UPDATE",1348

However, phenytoloxamine and acetaminophen tablets ARE still available and fully legal.

Flowbee Hair Cutter,0/0,4.0,The Hair Cutter works fine. It is easy to use for my butch haircut. The only thing is the attachment to the vacume cleaner. The vacume creates too much vacume and pulls on some of the skin areas making that spot shorter than areas around the affected spot. I now know not to turn on the vacume cleaner until I am through using the unit because the Flowbee has it's own vacumebuilt in to the unit.,6983

Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,"I don't know why, but it seemed like the dogs would like having the slight elevation, and indeed they do. It's like getting on the furniture, I guess that's why. Also, it's easier for my dog who is older and large and clunky and doesn't jump so well. She can elevate herself by simply stepping up, it's not very tall, but tall enough. It's cool. Someone else put it together for me, I wouldn't have wanted to have to do it.",4322
"KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Black",0/0,5.0,I have always used these Kongs for my dogs large and small. The extra large I used for my pit bull and it lasted a good while before she tore it up. I bought this one for my German Shepherd and it has outlasted her and my Lab is now happily chewing it. I love the way you can throw it and it bounces like crazy. The dog loves that too. Also you can put treats or peanut butter inside it for a great long lasting treat. This is a great item and I recommend it to everyone.,7330
Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,1/1,1.0,"I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS of the electrical transformer not working or failing shortly after first using, however, I chose ignore the negative comments because of the high percentage of good reviews. I hooked up the track and transformer exactly as per the instructions. Nothing happened. I used a volt meter to check the output power. Not only was there no power to the track, the whistle did not worked on the transformer either. I called the Lionel ""Customer Service"" number listed on the assembly instructions. A recording said I was number 9 in line. I waited OVER TWO HOURS until I finally got down to the #2 position in line. I waited for another 20 minutes and still no one answered so I finally gave up. Lionel is NOT the company it used to be. With all the negative reviews in regard to a faulty electric transformer, and now with my own personal experience, I am suspect on just how safe (fire, shock, etc) an electric transformer with multiple failures really is. I am not going to have an unsafe electrical device around my grandchildren.",3861

No tangled leash, no knocking over chairs, freedom to move around, perfect. I store them in the RV shower. They're light enough to move around easily. The bars on each panel make them good to configure and they're sturdy enough to not be easily knocked over if bumped.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the little plastic caps on the tops of the panel bars pop off so easily, I've just taken to throwing them away. They're only cosmetic, so the functionality is not impaired, but it's a little annoying.",3030

Aleph Bet Look & See Puzzle,0/0,4.0,"i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this puzzle for the price. I love how under each letter there is a picture as well as the hebrew word for the picture. I thought there would just be a picture so that's great. The only thing i don't like is that the hole for each place to put the letter is not very deep-the letter stays in nicely but for a two year old playing with it, i can see that the letters will fall out and potentially will get lost, if he carries the puzzle to another area in the room. My parents have a puzzle from the 80's where the area for each letter is deeper so the pieces don't come out as easily. but i am overall very happy with my purchase. the colors are very vibrant, the actual puzzle itself is made very well. I just wish that where you put each letter could be somewhat deeper. the letters do stay put even when the puzzle is standing upright so don't get me wrong, it's not like the puzzle is poorly made- the pieces do stay there. it's more of a personal preference. great puzzle! :)",3233

Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets,0/0,5.0,I love this product!!! I have a 2yr old Labrador. He was diagnosed with FMCP Bi-laterly when he was nine months old. For people who don't know this is one form of elbow dysplasia and he has it in both elbows. Needless to say I was a little freaked out. I was conscerned that I would have to put him down before the 12-15 years I had planned to spend with him had passed. It broke my heart that I might only have my pup for 5-8 years. My puppy's SportsVet recomended this product. He is doing great and I know that this product is not only reducing the progression of his condition but because he doesn't miss a day it is acutally going to extend his life.My Lab will even beg for one because he thinks these are treats. I don't know if all dogs would like them but if you own a 'foodie' dog they certainly wont' refuse them.This is truely a very affordable product. After the first weeks (4-6?) the dosage is one tablet per day for my Lab is one tablet per day. This means my bottle lasts for 150 days. When you divide the dosage (1 chewable pill) and the amount per bottle (150) by the days used (150) Dasaquin is cheaper than most other products on the market.,8627

"Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue",2/2,4.0,I did not receive the same model number as described in the product description. I received the RV-7497 which does not have an ION on/off switch with light. It does have the ION technology and am happy with it. I purchased this as a replacement for the same brand/styler which wore out after several years of daily use. I believe this is a newer model than the one shown in the product description as the one I had purchased several years ago was the model with the ION switch. This is the best of the hot air styling brushes I have tried and it is a good value. I was happy to find it on Amazon.com after not being able to find it at my local retailer. I deducted one star from my rating because it is a bit louder than I would like it to be. Since you have to hold it closer to your head than a regular hair dryer and especially when you are holding it near the ear....it would be nice if they could reduce the sound.,2716

I guess that shouldn't be a surprise. It was entertaining and funny.",8719
"Domeboro Astringent Solution, one box of 12 packets",0/0,5.0,"My son got severe hives from a virus - unknown which virus it is - and had SEVERE itching, so much so he was almost hysterical. We were applying all kinds of topical sprays and creams and it would help for a bit but kept itching until the Benadryl kicked in. Saw the allergist and he said NO creams or sprays, they only make things worse due to alcohol in them - that Calamine MIGHT help but otherwise have to keep administering Benadryl, which I didn't want to do. Came home and saw a box of Domeboro my husband got when he had poison ivy - dissolved the powder into water, and applied to my son's itchy areas - provided IMMEDIATE long lasting relief. SO GLAD we have this, because it is on national backorder and not to be found anywhere....oh and the regular price is VERY CHEAP like $12, this price must be $49 due to backorder status.",2547

I tried it in a shower, and nothing, absolutely nothing happened even though I scrubbed with a sponge. Same thing with my refrigerator that had grown black mildew in the folds of the sealer. In this case, I managed to scrub the mildew away with a sponge, but the same thing occurs when I only use soap and water. Also, this product does not prevent mildew from coming back. I hate to use bleach, and I wish there was a safe product out there that got rid of mildew, but this is not it.",1697
MTL Polishing Cloth Kit,1/1,5.0,"I am a watch collector, and a large portion of my collection consists of watches built from stainless steel. Over the years many of my watches lost their shine and built up dirt so I decided to search for a product that would be great for cleaning and also polishing so I can bring out the beauty of the time pieces again. After doing hours of research and speaking to other watch collectors, majority recommended me this Item. At first I did not expect much due to the low price, however once I cleaned and polished my time pieces using this product, I must say it brought out their true beauty again, removed dirt and even some little scratches around the body of the watches. This product is absolutely incredible and a must have for anyone who is in need to polish items that are crafted from stainless steel. The best aspect of this item has to be how strong the pre moistened polishing cloths are. I cut about two little pieces off one polishing cloth and that was enough for me to polish 15 watches. Since we are provided with twelve 4"" x 6"" cloths, I can estimate that this amount will last me for years, so for the price it is a phenomenal buy. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend it to everyone.",7439

That is why I nearly swooned when I saw SmartCat's offering on Amazon. After living with this scratcher for 4 months, I can tell you it is as beautiful as I hoped (well, as beautiful as a scratching post can be) and our cat uses it for 95% of her scratching needs (I don't think a lifetime of squirts from a water bottle will ever curb her love affair with our green armchair). After mounting it to the wall, this scratcher almost disappears from view. Happiness.",5587
POSTURE-PRO Adjustable Double Diner,0/0,3.0,"I ordered two of these for my dogs - we have a newfoundland and a mastiff. One of them came with three missing screws on one leg (where the leg is attached to the top) - and when I found the screws loose in the box and attempted to screw them in myself, I discovered that the screws were stripped. Which is probably why they fell out. I was able to replace with three slightly larger screws of my own, but the legs on both are still pretty wobbly when fully extended. The previous reviews I read said that this product was very sturdy, so I don't know if mine was poorly put together.We're going to attempt to stabilize and made them less wobbly, because the price is really good, and these are the perfect height for my dogs. The bowls are good quality, and the top wood piece feels very well-made.Edited to change star rating",5985

Sinus Buster Classic Formula by Sinus Buster - .68 Ounces,1/2,4.0,"I just got this product--my ENT told me about it on the sly. I had auffered loss of smell in my right side after a hideous sinus infection in July. I went to two ENTs, an allergist, did acupuncture. Nothing. I just tried this stuff (one spray at a time, as the scaredy cats on this site made me nervous about it), and for this first time in weeks I could smell a bit! About 15%, but still, it was almost an immediate result. So i went ahead and did the second spray.It burns ever so slightly and lasts for about 5 seconds. Do not listen to these complainers; it's even kind of refreshing. I am recommending this product to everyone I know with chronic sinus problems as well as to those with migraines (that includes me, too).I do not give this product 5 stars only because it is so new to me. But I had to come on and post as soon as I got the result that I did.",1020

Yes, I now use it along with a medically presribed nasal spray but when I first tried the nasal spray it did't work at all. I tried the breathe right strips and it didn't work at all. I put on the breathe right strip one night and without thinking about it gave myself a half-hearted shot of the nasal spray in each nostril and suddenly realized I was breathing clearly and easily. Since that night I have used the two in conjunction with each other and have no problems. My allergies don't interfere with my sleeping, my breathing doesn't interfere and I feel just fine. Not happy with the result from your own trial usage? Try it this way. I recommend it highly. It will change the way you sleep.",951

Stainless Steel Pet Coop Cup,2/3,4.0,"Can't say too much about this cup only that it works as intended! The clamp holds the cup very secure. It doesn't budge once you screw it down tight (but not too tight!). I ordered the 8oz cup to use as my dog's food bowl (I previously bought a 32oz cup that hangs). Having both the clamp and hang-style cups, I must say that either one will work. However, I would advise against getting the large (48oz+) cup in the clamp-style version. That much weight with food or water in it may put a lot of tension on the welds of the clamp over time. Nonetheless, I'm impressed with this cup. Definitely worth purchasing.***12/26/12 Update",4756

Rattlesnake Eggs,1/1,5.0,"I'm 64 -- this year -- and had one of these whenIwas a kid.What you do is, very carefully, wind up the mechanism --[it's a machined washer on a rubberband]. Put it verycarefully back in the envelope, and put it where the""victim"" will SEE it.The victim reads the envelope and -- like Pandora's Box --think to themselves ""Yeah.. Right! Rattlesnake eggs? Ha!""Okay, now they have taken the bait.Since you --carefully-- put the envelope down, the victimonly has to barely touch the envelope, and it goes a rattlin'!This noise will make him scream like a little girl.

Gourmet Pet Feeder,0/0,5.0,"I thought that the big clear plastic storage bin would be difficult to manage, but it is not. It is locked into the base. You add the kibble by taking the lid off of the top and pouring it in. The opening is more than wide enough to pour straight from the bag. I put a full 10 pounds of cat food in the container. The little kitten has no problems eating from it and the food falls right down to refill it. Excellent solution.",8396
"Corolle Mon Premier Tidoo 12"" Baby Doll (Tidoo Suce Pouce In PJs)",0/0,5.0,My granddaughter is enjoying this item. She plays with this doll in the tub each night. Most of her dolls are not water friendly so she enjoys this very much.,8316

K&H Pet Bed Warmer,0/0,3.0,"I'll go ahead and use these, but next time I'll get heating pads (which is basically what they are anyway) except that then I could set the temperature myself. Supposedly these automatically set to different temperatures according to a cat's presence but now that I've seen them I believe that's improbable. They are just stiff plastic sleeves with the kind of wiring inside that electric blankets have. Heating pads would be cheaper, better quality and I think, safer.",3312

Japonesque Handi Jar Pack 4 piece,0/0,2.0,"It does the job. The product quality is great but the lids do not stay screwed on tightly as others. Its compact and great for traveling or carrying it for everyday. The bad thing is that for the largest case, i placed my power foundation and its a bit too small for that. i use the lid to spread the foundation and the powder gets stuck in between the screw lines and causes the container to become loose. One of the lids with a clear top, the clear part came off. now there's the use of the lid.",3334
Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"One of the best cat toys ever. The first one I bought was stolen by my best friend's cats, so I had to buy another. Now this one is a favorite for my number 3 cat...All four of my dolls love it..but the 2 year old says it's her special toy...All I have to do is to call her name and ask her &#34;Where is your toy..where is it.&#34; and she starts looking all over..even under blankets and pillows on the bed, which is where she loves to play with it the most. Over time however she has managed to tear it in half and I've never found the end peice..I may need a replacement soon, since I have a 5 month old kitten who loves it too.",7736

There's no light leaking around your nose while wearing it, which has been an issue for me with similar products. I highly recommend it.",4358
Melissa & Doug Food Groups,0/0,3.0,"I love the selection of foods in this set but many of the pieces already had paint-transfer marks when they arrived. Also, the paint seems to be rubbing off as we play (we just received it today) so this set just doesn't seem durable.

Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"Unlike the Buster Cube and other hard plastic treat dispensing toys, this toy is soft, so when your dog rolls it around the floor to get the treats, you won't want to pull your hair out and your floors and furniture will not be damaged. Another key benefit is that you can adjust the size of the opening by unscrewing the two parts a little more, making it easy to use a range of food or treat sizes. This gets regular use at my house.",3555

Phyto Phytophanere Dietary Supplement for Hair Nails and Skin,1/1,5.0,I had to have chemotherapy in the past and it took out the majority of my hair.... I was devastated. Someone told me about this product and I figured I had nothing to loose since my hair was already gone. I bought this product after I had finished my chemo and within a months time my hair was growing back thick and strong. I would reccomend this product to anyone if they are having problems with there hair falling out or thinning.,5533
HEAT WAVE Instant Reusable Heat Pack HAND WARMERS - 4 pack = 2 pairs Heat Wave; PLUS FREE CARRYING/STORAGE CASE,0/0,1.0,I purchased these based on my experience with a similar product from Campmor (which no longer offers this product). You get 20 minutes of heat (max) and it is NOT hot. The one I bought from Campmor 15 years ago gets almost too hot to touch and lasts for 2 hours. I will be returning these.,8095
Magnetic Gyro Wheel by Schylling,0/0,4.0,"My son has sensory sensitivity issues and he loves this toy; he says it makes his hand feel better. I'm not sure exactly what that means for him, but he's left-handed and his hand probably gets cramped from learning to write, so maybe it eases tension there. He seems to also find it mesmerizing.As others have written, I too, had one of these when I was a kid, and I didn't care for it much (found it boring), but it was also quite indestructible and could not be put out of alignment. The metal rods in this one are very easy to bend, so they get out of alignment at the hands of most kids easily, and I have to realign them often. If they're slightly out of alignment the rolling of the wheel is uneven and unsatisfactory, and if it is very out of alignment, it won't work and the wheel falls off.For the the price you pay (under $5.00) you can't expect stellar quality, so take 5 minutes every now and then to realign it. It does work, and while fixing it, enjoy talking to your kid about this simple, non-electronic toy that you had as a kid ""back in the day"" and enjoy the opportunity to communicate with your kid instead of looking at your smartphone.",5576

DURACELL C12 PROCELL Professional Alkaline Battery,0/0,5.0,"I ended up buying these batteries instead of the Costco pack of AAA batteries that I usually get. They were a little less expensive and seem to work about the same.What I LOVE about these batteries over others I have purchased is the packaging. They come in very small boxes of 4 batteries each. My occupation requires me to carry a ton of stuff and the small size and convenience of how these are packaged makes it just that much stuff I have to carry. I can grab a 4 pack and throw it in the gear and it barely takes up any room.They came in a regular, long envelope. I was wondering what the envelope could be and had no idea it would be batteries until I opened it! They were packaged that minimally!",7433
Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,"I bought these for my entire family. My three kids NEVER brush for the full two minutes, so this is great because it won't shut off until the two minutes are up. The batteries they come with don't seems to last that long, but when I replaced them with Eveready batteries, they last a long time. Very good deal.",9337
"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,I have been struggling with the automatic cat box.....Lots of digging and cleaning out of the &#34;grill&#34; that NEVER seems to put in into the container?....(It gets pushed under the container that is supposed to put it in it)....My daughter works at Pet Smart??...Anyway I am the happiest cat person!!...I don't have to dig....or clean out....I can clean it out in about 45 seconds...(Used to take 20 minutes)......Whoever thought this one up......HATS OFF TO YOU!!,8022

SweatVac Headband,0/0,3.0,"I have been having a difficult time finding a good headband for when I workout, most of them are too thin or won't stay in place.

"Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)",3/3,1.0,"Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)I have been eating this cereal every morning for many years. My last shipment was different in several ways. The flakes were thicker, tough and stuck in my teeth, and there was a gritty feel which gave me kind of a sore tongue. I contacted the cereal company online and they promised to make it right. Said the cereal had not changed its formula but during the period in question, there was a glitch and the flakes were rolled thinner. Didn't seem that to me, just the opposite, plus the taste was altered for the worse. They have sent me coupons to buy Nature's Path products, but no one around my small town carries it. I will use them, however, when I get to a larger city, 50 miles away. I then ordered the same cereal ""with raisins"" described as plump and juicy raisins, from a different on-line distributor. It's the same, except the raisins are like little hard rocks. We ground the first shipment up for the birds, but they won't eat it either.",277

China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"I love, love, love this color for the summer time! It shows off your tan really well and is a nice neon without being unattractively bright. The only reason that I don't give it five stars is that it doesn't stay on nearly as well as my other China Glaze polishes. Even after using a base coat and Seche Vite, I still have a problem with it chipping after a few days. I've had this problem with every neon I've ever owned, so I don't know if it's something to do with the color, but it is frustrating. Other than that, I am thrilled with this polish and highly recommend this color!",2099
"Cardinal Gates Patio Door Guardian, White",0/0,5.0,"Very solid, very secure. Keeps the kids inside, everybody else outside. The vent position allows for fresh air and the gap is small enough to prevent the kids from slipping out, however the cat does slip through. Can pull and turn lock to disable. If you forget to do this and the kids close the door behind you, you are very securely locked out of the house.",6404

GladRags The Keeper,0/0,5.0,"Just received my moon cup today and in time to actually use it. It's working great for me so far. I had read previous reviews about difficult insertion so I decided to do this in the shower, had no problems. I don't feel it when it is in. I did have to trim the stem to fit my body. Overall I believe this is a wonderful product and I hope it becomes more well known to the general female population. So long icky pads and tampons!",1181

Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,0/0,5.0,"We purchased this swing in 2009 for our first baby, mainly because it was one of the only ones available at the time that plugged into the wall. Three years and two babies later it's still working like new and I'm giving it to my sister for her new baby. The cover is easily removed and washes beautifully, the little mobile animals can be spot cleaned. It's pretty quiet, but it does have a bit of motor noise- both my kids actually found that soothing. There are variable volume settings, as well as different music and rainforest noises. The mobile also has an independent on and off switch, which was nice when I wanted the mobile on for them to look at, but not the music. It's easily taken apart for storage, but it's not a great option for a lot of car transport, as it's pretty big. We set it up in a quiet corner of our family room and occasionally moved it around the house. It does fold up to get through doors, so moving it throughout the house is no problem. Both of our sons were on the large side, and this swing handled their weight and length just fine. We found this swing to be one of the best baby purchases we made.",6465
Now Foods CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) 800 mg,6/6,4.0,I have been using this product as a part of my recent weight loss regimen. It seems that my appetite has subsided slightly while on the product leading to less food cravings.My weight loss has been steady and consistent over the last two weeks. My beginning weight/body fat was 245lbs @ 23% and two weeks later I am at 240lbs @ 21.1%.Those numbers may not seem very impressive to you but you must know that I have not changed my diet or workout routine at all.

After just 6 weeks of using this conditioner, my stylist wanted to know what I had switched to as my hair was healthier than it has ever been. She was quite surprised when I told her Paul Mitchell.

Tried the first serving with filtered water, eeekkkk, had to gag it down. It tastes like sawdust! I used a magic bullet for 5 minutes to blend it and it still settled at the bottom.2nd serving I used 1% milk and 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. Not much improvement.Before I tried it I was going to do the 14-day starting phase. No way I could gag this down 3 times a day for 14 days, let alone ONE day!Really wish it tasted and dissolved better.",836
Macks safe sound soft foam earplugs -10 pair,0/0,5.0,"I work nights, and I live in a house with a very noisy family with a 3 year old and this was the solution to all my problems. I have tried a lot of different brands, and different types of earplugs within this same brand and none of them worked as good as these ones.It is true they only last around 3 or 4 uses in my case but the box is quite cheap and well worth it.I do have one ear canal smaller than the other one, on one ear they fit perfectly and in the other they hurt a bit and ended up not fitting well at all but I figured that an option (which I don't know how it would work for everybody but that's what I did) was to flat out the earplug and cut just A LITTLE bit with scissors and they would fit perfectly. The noise is not blocked as perfectly as with the other one but it is still a huge difference if you learn how much you need to cut. I might be the weird one here but it might be helpful for some people that couldn't make them fit. And in my case I tried smaller ones but they didn't block the noise at all in my compared to these ones",48

Aveeno Anti Itch Soothing Bath Treatment - 4.5 Oz,0/0,5.0,"It is thicker than the cheaper brands though you need to take time for it to desolve. Otherwise, crumps will surface.

"Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Whole Grain Penne Pasta, 12-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Don't be concerned that whole grain means it will have a rough texture or objectionable taste. We all love it. It cooks up great, either al dente (slightly firm) or really soft for the kids. The flavor is mild, meaning that you won't think you are eating a piece of 9-grain bread when you eat it. We love that we can feel this to our kids and know that they are getting all the great health benefits of whole grains, as opposed to refined grains in typical pasta. For our 2-year-old twins, we cut the cooked tubes in half, just to be sure they don't choke on the longer pieces of pasta. Everybody perks up when Daddy says, &#34;How about if we have pasta today?&#34;",7430

"Adaptil, D.A.P (Dog Appeasing Pheromone) Collar for Medium to Large Dogs - 27.6""",0/1,1.0,"Our Chocolate Lab has a lot of anxiety/fear issues & we bought this after his trainer from puppy school recommended it, hoping it would help appease his anxiety a little. Honestly did not make the slightest difference in his behavior. We tried it for the first time right before a 3hr car ride (he usually has anxiety in the car) and to my surprise, his anxiety was actually WORSE than it normally is in the car. I tried checking the papers inside to see if there was a Money Back Guarantee, but there isn't. Very upset I wasted so much money on this. :(",4176
HTP Plantar Fasciitis Heel Seats,1/1,5.0,"I was encouraged by other reviews to purchase the HTP Heel Seats for my trip to Israel. All other inserts had not helped but the Heel Seats were the best for my ""All Terrain"" sport shoes trekking all over the country and walking through the different airports to make our connecting flights. In the beginning, it is uncomfortable to have any insert in one's shoes but eventually, I could no longer feel the pain and could walk for longer periods with no trouble.I highly recommend HTP Heel Seats to Plantar sufferers. They really work.",794

But the cross bar on the bottom is bolted on both ends, and I had 1 end snap off after about a week. I will be able to find something at the hardware store to fix it, but this is not as sturdy as it was advertised.

Four Paws Easy Feeder for Pets,0/0,2.0,"I bought these to dose an aquarium with fertilizer and fill small test tubes. They didn't work out, though. After less than two months they started to become rough and eventually bind. I realize that my application isn't conventional, but I think the issues I had also apply to their intended use.The good:-The markings have held up well, though they are starting to fade. Putting packing tape over the cylinder might be a good way to preserve them, but I haven't tried it.-Fairly high capacity.-The tapered tips lets you tailor them to a certain use.The bad:-Although they started out smooth, that didn't last long. In my case their useful life was only two months while being used every one or two days.-The plungers lock when depressed all the way, which makes extracting something difficult because you have to pop it loose. I don't understand why their designed that way, but if someone knows of a reason for it, then feel free to post a comment.",834

Now that she's almost 3, we needed to break her of the habit so she may have straight teeth. Our dentist recommended Mavala. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit concerned that the product would affect her eating habits. I didn't have to worry. The Mavala broke her of the thumb sucking in about a week. I am still pretty amazed. I thought it would take much longer to break her habit. I didn't notice any issues with her eating, although I can see how it might cause some concern with young children, since almost everything is finger food.",2299
"Horizon Organic Low Fat Milk, Vanilla, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 18)",0/0,4.0,"Do you know how much a dairy cow weighs on average? How many gallons of water a cow drinks in a single day? You would if you got this Horizon Organic milk.I have a passion for all things drinkable with a straw right out of the pouch, mostly because it saves me from having to creatively squeeze in yet another dirty glass to the pile of dishes already waiting in my sink. This straw that is included in every pouch is this milk's biggest asset, second only to its rich vanilla taste, of course.Nothing like sitting down to watch some News on TV on a saturday morning, with a plate of scrambled eggs in one hand and this 8 oz pack of low fat vanilla milk in the other. You just stick the straw in and enjoy the deliciousness. The rectangular thick paper pouch is just big enough for a nice, easy hold. You feel good holding it, like when you wrap your fingers around the iPhone, or when you hold a handyman's driller or something. Then you take a sip through the straw and you quickly transform into an adult kid of sorts.I get my boxes from Costco. They are cheaper in bulk, of course. They have it in chocolate and strawberry flavors but I always get the Vanilla kind, I don't know why. I do want to try the other flavors though. It is organic milk but frankly, you can't tell if it tastes different from the regular, non-organic milk because of its vanilla flavor or inherent richness. And it's already sweetened so I wouldn't recommend using this milk with cereal that already has some sugar in it. But I do have another way you can enjoy this milk. As a dessert, no less!Pour one pouch of this milk into your ice cube tray. Sprinkle some walnuts and pistachios and dig in a toothpick. 2 hours later, you have yourself a nice frozen treat. Kids will love it too.Judging by the package design, I suppose you would say it's kids' milk. But do you really care? It tastes good, is nutritious enough and quenches your thirst, whether you are young or old. So cheers...to the little kid in all of us.",9017
Bio Kleen Oxygen Bleach Plus,0/0,5.0,"This stuff works so well on my laundry, that I started using it for cleaning stubborn stains around the house (in the carpet shampooer, washing away mildew in the shower, cleaning dog doodie area in the back yard, etc) but even if you only use it for laundry, you'll be SO glad you tried it. It works WAY BETTER than bleach ever did, without the harsh wear and tear on your clothes. I've removed stains that I thought would NEVER come clean by making a paste and putting that paste directly the stain for a few hours before washing.... this method removed both coffee and lipstick stains that had already been washed AND DRIED into the fabric! It's unbelievable that it works so well, and nobody seems to know about it. But one thing is for sure... I'll never use anything other than this bleach!",8854

Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,4.0,"My dog is a puller and likes to slip out of her harness. The easy walk works pretty good to stop both. My dog seems to like this harness a lot. The thing is I don't use it. I use the Gentle Leader Head Collar which is the greatest dog collar/harness ever made. The easy walk helps the pulling, but the Gentle Leader Head collar eliminates it. It's a catch 22. Go with the easy walk and still have a bit of pulling, but your dog won't mind wearing it. Now go with the head collar, you won't have pulling but your dog won't be as comfortable (my dog got use to it and now wears it with no problems).",1792

"The Gluten-Free Pantry All-Purpose Flour, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I've tried mixing my own gluten free flour concoctions, which is expensive and a bit cumbersome. Also, this last summer, when it is was so hot, ingredients straight from the bin at the Coop went rancid. The store owners explained that to avoid the possibility of bacteria in those bins, it is safer to use packaged material. When I tried this flour, it did the trick as well or better than anything I made on my own, and the cost, actually, is about the same. Just easier on me. I don't have to add any other ingredients to make it work as &#34;regular&#34; flour in our recipes for pie dough, shortcake, etc. Haven't tried making bread with it, because I just buy frozen gluten free bread.",6935

FootSmart Bunion Regulator,1/1,4.0,"I own two of these, one for each foot. Overall, I find that they work really well in alleviating foot pain, so long as you use them consistently. I would wear them each night right before going to bed - initially starting with a very loose fit, but over time making the velcro just a little tighter to help correct my foot problem. The problem is that sometimes the brace isn't very comfortable. On me, for some reason I don't feel as uncomfortable with my left foot in the brace as I do with my right - and what would happen is I'd wake up in the morning, and discover that in my sleep I'd kicked off or removed the right brace b/c it was bothering me. Somehow though I guess the left wasn't so annoying, because usually that one was still on. If you can manage to get a comfortable fit with this thing, it works well - but if it isn't comfortable, the truth is you probably won't wear it and/or benefit from it.",5015

Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,2/2,4.0,"With reasonable expectations you should be pleased with this product. Our wire-haired fox terrier always has to ""have the last bark"" with neighboring dogs (typical stubborn, willful terrier traits) -- this behavior has dramatically improved. The device works well within these paramaters:1) For our yard configuration, it's a ""line of sight"" type of device -- depending on the size of your yard, it may not impact your neighbor's dogs, random wandering bands of dogs, or your own dog if s/he is too far away (such as around the other side of the house). It has a very long cord, so I move it around every week or so, and the dog hasn't figured it out.2) It doesn't stop barking, it interrupts a barking sequence -- for it to work, you dog has to be repeatedly barking. It appears to distract the dog, taking the steam out of the barking episode. The device doesn't prevent all barking, and the dog has to get going on a string of repeated barks for impact. But, it does interrupt the cycle, and shorten the cycles for my dog. She may bark once or twice, then kind of give up - she has a weird ""half bark"" when the tone goes off, and then it's pretty much over.3) It doesn't put a big dent in ""barking for a cause"" - such as a brazen cat wandering along the fence top, taunting the dog. When there's a good reason (in dog logic) to bark vigorously, my dog is unphased by the device, initially. She does seem loose interest in the barking sooner, though.All in all, happy with the purchase, and would recommend.Update February 2013 -- still working! Dog woke me up at 5 am barking (a rarity now), but again, 4-5 barks at a time, then she basically gives up. Very happy with this result for my dog/yard combination!",2167

Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,0/0,5.0,"My 4 year old son is a huge Polar Express fan... it's his favorite movie and has sparked an interest in trains. He has another smaller Polar Express set that has been played with non-stop. The Lionel G-Gauge version is a wonderful upgrade! The train itself is a fairly large scale with good detail that is resilent for a younger user (the little video on the Amazon site doesn't do it justice). The sound effects are good, the lighting on the front and in the fire box are fun, and the overall opertion is great.There are a couple of minor issues on the negative. The track connections are okay, but a couple of the track section connection points had excess plastic in them that required some clean-up with a hobby knife. The only other minor issue is the train car connectors... for younger players, they are a little hard to connect and keep the wheels on the track.Regardless, this is a great set for any fan of the Polar Express! I am especially looking forward to setting it up around the Christmas tree... assuming I can get it away from my son!",9464

I've owned 2 of these masks...the first one lasted about 3 years, and the 2nd one is still in pretty good shape after almost 4 years. It's very comfortable, and the back strap is long enough to accommodate even bigger heads, without feeling like your head is in a wrench with some of these other sleep masks.",7581

"Sanyo 1,000 mAh AAA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries 4-Pack",0/0,5.0,"These uniquely support the very high discharge rate needed to fully power my Fenix LD01 flashlight on high.As good as the eneloop AAAs are, and they are better for resisting self-discharge for low discharge rate applications like remote controls, mice, etc, they won't support the high discharge rate that kills them in under an hour when producing 80 Lumens in an LED flashlight. Instead, the current is restricted down to nearly the MED setting.These 1000 mAh batteries will provide full power, and they'll almost double the run-time duration of many bicycle lights. They do self-discharge though, at least more so than the eneloop cells, so if you use something rarely, go with the eneloops.I carry these as my installed batteries, with 2 more carried as spares, and one eneloop cell to make 3. This has proven to be a 100% reliable system.These 1000mAh cells are truly spectacular performers.",159
Ideal Pet Products 6.25-by-6.25-Inch Lockable Cat Flap with Telescoping Frame,0/0,5.0,"Recently installed one of these in our laundry room door so the cats can get to their food, water, and litter box. Took about 20 minutes to install. After laying out the template, I used a drill to create pilot holes in the corners. Then I used my jigsaw to cut between the pilot holes and to square out the corners. Then it was a simple matter of screwing the two halves together. Installation looks good, and the door is very simple to use. I highly recommend this product.",5530
Jessica McClintock Eau de Parfum,1/1,1.0,"I purchased this perfume for a friend as a gift. A few days after I gave my friend this perfume she called to ask me where I purchased it from so she could return/exchange it due to it smelling - OLD, MUSTY, and SOUR. I am mortified and embarrassed. I don't see anywhere on here where I can talk to the seller or ask for a replacement or refund. Needless to say, I will not be ordering again. I am highly disappointed. :(",6376
PoochPad Pet Training Pad,0/0,5.0,"I got these in a 2-set before ever trying disposable pads and I'm so glad for that. Initially I felt they were costly, but learned they were definitely worth it. They're very good, and I got over a year use out of one, washing it in only water every 48-72hrs, washing until the water ran clear. (One 6lb dog in household) After 6 months I did add a teaspoon of detergent to the water because it became necessary, but before that, it wasnt. A good rinsing/wash was always enough. After the yr, I realized the product had lived up to its promise, because obviously it had survived hundreds of washings and still worked. It came to need replacing and I realized that because it would smell after washing and seemed to be a little less absorbant. Would recommend and will definitely buy again.",4621
ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water,1/1,3.0,"The first batch I got was fairly good, the second batch had a plastic sort of taste. I didn't realize how bad it was until I tried some side-by-side with some Taste Nirvana brand.So my recommendation so far is Taste Nirvana, I just ordered some Amy and Brian's I will update here once I get it and compare.Update:The Amy and Brians young coconut water/juice is really good. Expect something a bit different than you are used to as it is a young coconut water. Very sweet but not overpowering, needs to be drinken cold for best flavor.",1243

IQ Baby Knock-Knock Blocks,0/0,5.0,I bought these for my 5 month old daughter. I wanted to get her toys that don't light up and make noise and these blocks have been a hit! She can sit up on her own and I'll set the blocks up in front of her. She reaches out for them and chews on them. Hopefully soon she will understand the peek-a-boo windows when she gets a little older. Great choice for parents looking for toys that challenges the creativity in your child. One day I'd like to get her into Legos!,733
Original Gyroscope / Boxed,0/0,2.0,"I had fun with this product for the first few days that i had it, but after spinning it enough, the bearing starts to wear out and it doesn't retain it's spin as long. The string was also fairly weak and broke after a few days of use. Not that finding another string is hard, but it was definitely annoying. If i could go back, I would probably shell out some extra cash to get a higher quality gyroscope.",7976

PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack),0/0,3.0,We got the indoor fence system to keep the dog out of a part of the house.

Eminence Organic Skincare. Stone Crop Hydrating Gel,0/0,2.0,"This product was just ok. When I looked at the bottle and noticed that it didn't have the copyright symbol on it.....It made me wonder whether or not it was the real product or was it a generic? When I used it on my face,it didn't feel any better and didn't see any positive results from it. Next time I will try it out at the spa salon to see if it is any different.

Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,1.0,"I usually buy this product at the vet, but decided to buy on line to save a few bucks. Well, it worked, for a week or two, but it is supposed to protect for much longer and break the life cycle of the fleas. Within the month, I found myself buying a different brand from a more reputable seller (still on line because I'm a sucker for a ""good deal""). I did a little on line research and apparently it is quite common to end up with imposter frontline when ordering on line -as it's supposed to only be sold by vets. I am now pretty skeptical about whether or not I really used Frontline, or a fancy fake...",2049

"Eureka Tub Of Letter Tiles, 176 Tiles in 3 3/4"" x 5 1/2"" x 3 3/4"" Tub",1/1,4.0,"I have no big complaints about these tiles. They are used almost daily in my classroom and all the tiles have retained their letters. I have had other sets that had the paint wear away with frequent use, but these look great. I have even washed them in soapy water a couple times, and they hold up well. The capital &#34;I&#34; doubles as a lowercase &#34;l&#34; which I did not like, so I used a sharpie to add extra lines. Also, the capital &#34;M&#34; is simply an upside down &#34;W&#34; which I do not prefer. I wish the capital &#34;ms&#34; had staright outside lines instead of slanting lines. I could not alter the W's to correct the problem, but overall, I am still happy with this purchase. NOTE",3802

Vicks 1.5 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light,1/1,4.0,"I have been using this type of Vick's model for about 7 years and here is what I have found works (many of these have already been listed in other reviews):-- If you have a water softener, this will work just fine. If you don't and you have hard water, adding salt is a requirement (you are essentially boiling water with this model)-- Cleaning - Water minerals will be left behind so you may see black particles or even larger chunks in the water.The particles should just be just dumped out, rinse the container and add new water. If you see larger chunks, you absolutely need to clean the unit (per Vick's instructions). I've always just unscrewed the unit and cleaned off the build-up. NOTE",4329

I got tired of the usual steroids and medications for their old and creaky bodies and began looking for something easier on their system, especially their stomachs. For whatever reason, Rimadyl caused havoc with my Bulldogs intestinal tract after prolonged usage of a few months. A friend of mine recommended DGP, figured I'd try it after a GI bleed episode with my male Bulldog who was on Rimadyl. I believe my dog functions just as well on the DGP as he did on the medications from the vet. I realize when and if he gets real bad I'll have to do something else, but for now, the DGP appears to be doing a good job.",8214

They ate environment friendly and usually work really well, but these wipes were disappointing. They are extremely thin, so it's me 3 times as many wipes to get my little one clean.

I only gave them two stars since they are cruelty free and vegan. Will not be buying these again.",5355

Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,2/2,5.0,"My dog wore this all last winter and now he is wearing it this winter too. I wish it were longer. It's silly that they give the length of the coat and not the width. I wish his were longer down his back, but still he loves it.The coat arrived on a tiny hanger. I held it up to show friends, before showing it to the puppy dog, but he was already dancing and jumping because he somehow knew it was HIS. I put it on him and he just pranced all around thrilled to be wearing it.I have washed it many times inside a laundry mesh bag so the velcro doesn't tangle with other clothes. It still looks beautiful. Most days my little pooch has to wear a sweater in the winter, so when it's time to go for our walks, I pop on his coat and he is THRILLED!Everyone comments on the coat, because it is nice looking and not goofy at all. I am so sick and tired of the goofy stuff they make for dogs, I want my doggy to be warm and look nice. He seriously needs the warmth around his heart and lungs. You may need to use it over a sweater too, as the velcro tabs may not cover enough of the dogs heart and lungs.Thank goodness they included a slit in the shoulders for his harness, as it definitely looks cuter with the harness underneath and not on top. I have so many cute pictures of my dog wearing this. Just picking it up, send him dancing and jumping for joy, then he stands real still while I put it on him. Sometimes when we come back home, he runs off with his coat still on, not wanting me to take it off at all, even though I have the heat turned up for him.",2872

It smells a little more &#34;Bath & Bodyworks&#34; than I had anticipated; it's got a decidedly girl-ish (as in the type of young teen who buys that fake vanilla scent at the mall - bleh) scent to it straight out of the bottle, but it mellows out and the scent doesn't linger. Despite that, I won't be using it as a body wash -- this bottle will be delegated to dish duty and the like.I think I will try the Lavender scent next -- I hear that it smells more like the actual Lavender plant, as opposed to the chemically-formed, mall-bought version.",6965

As the other reviewer stated, it is nice that the cap can go back on after use. I love these so much that I don't even use a lancet device to prick my finger. I just poke the needle in my finger. I was bruising from the devices and doing it on my own allows me to control the amount of pressure used. I continue to use the 30 gauge because they are great and I don't want to spend the extra $$ on the 33 gauge. I highly recommend these! I also love that Amazon sells them (cheaper too!) because I've been having a hard time finding them at Target, CVS, Walgreens, etc.",2345

I have never seen a thicker coat on any dog or bigger knots, which are impossible to remove with $30 clippers from petco. I finally spent the extra money and it was 100% worth it! These clippers cut right through the under coat and knots with ease, I was very impressed. They get a little warm but the cooling lube takes care of that. What was a hour job is now cut down to 20 minutes, these clippers are defiantly worth the cash.",4108

Dior Homme Cologne by Christian Dior for men Colognes,2/3,5.0,"It's close to a perfectly crafted fragrance. This scent is built around lavender, iris, and cocoa. The opening drives some people nuts. It starts with very strong iris that is reminiscent of the scent used in makeup and lipstick. Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray. I rather like the smell, but I can see how it would not appeal to everyone. After the fragrance dries down, it comes into its own. The iris is pushed to the sideline, though it is still noticeable. Taking its place is a clean, rich lavender. While there are many lavender scents on the market, this is a very high quality lavender. But the imaginative part, and really the reason to buy the fragrance, is the pairing of this lavender with cocoa. This gives the lavender a sweetness and a depth that is unusual and excellent. It's not a gourmand fragrance, the cocoa is very much in the background, but it definitely colors the lavender to make for a unique experience. Dior Homme projects well throughout its 6-7 hour lifespan. Note",125

"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory",0/0,2.0,"I thought this tray would be the perfect accessory to my bumbo seat... Although it is nice for my baby to have a tray to play with his toys on or eat snacks on, I would not have purchased this knowing what I know now.Pros:*I like the fact I have the option to have a tray on my bumbo seat for my babies activities*It's plastic, so it's easy to clean*It's hard & Durable and not easy to breakCons:*The price they charge for this cheap piece of plastic is not worth it's value*It's difficult to attach to the bumbo seat... The top part attaches to the piece in between the babies legs , and there's a hook that latches to the bottom of the seat to secure it in place. You literally have to squish the seat to get the bottom latch on. Therefore, cannot do it while baby is in the seat. This is a problem since it's very difficult to get baby in the seat while the tray is attached, especially now that they have the safety belt. You need tiny hands to squeeze in between your baby and the seat belts with the tray in the way in order to buckle him in. It's just not worth the hastle...",2782

Finish Jet Dry Rinse Agent,0/1,5.0,"First off as a bachelor, I have never used Jet-Dry in the dishwasher. Where I live has very hard water and if the dishes are not removed immediately from the dishwasher and wiped hard water spots will cover the dishes. I decided to test the Jet-Dry on some crusty, un-rinsed dishes that had been in the sink for two weeks due to being out of town, and leave them in the dishwasher overnight. Normally this would require rinsing/scraping before the dishwasher. I put the dishes in on normal wash filled the dishwasher with Jet-Dry (thanks special lady for informing me that you just keep filling the dispenser till its full and check it periodically. Yes, I had to make a call to learn how to use Jet-Dry!). Washing dishes like this would usually leave some form of caked on crusty stuff, and leaving the dishes overnight would leave heavy hard water spots on the dishes/glasses. Much to my surprise, the dishes were spotless upon removal in the morning! There was no crusty food stuck to the plates or silverware, no spots on anything! I am amazed. I can say, if it can be helped, my dishes will never be washed sans Jet-Dry again.",2255
10 Game House,4/4,3.0,"This is a good combination of games, including some I'd never heard of before. You get all the pieces and instructions. It's all in one box. By that measure, this is an excellent value, and a great way to pass the time with family play.The problem is that you get what you pay for. This isn't solid wood. It's particle board with a cheap veneer. The game set arrived in a cardboard box surrounded with bubble pack cushions inside a larger box. No signs of damage on any of the packaging. Yet when we opened it up, we found that the game set was already in need of repair.The game boards you see pictured sliding out of the box are actually held up by small wooden shelves. Those shelves are glued to the inside of the box. There's no groove for them, no dovetailing, no screws or fasteners. Just a flat piece of particle board glued to another flat piece of particle board. And when the game set arrived, two of those shelves had already fallen off and needed to be glued back on. One corner of the Chinese Checkers tray needed to be glued back together, too.Treat it gently and keep a bottle of glue handy, and you'll have hours of family fun, with variety at your fingertips.",458

Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,"I had read things about raspberry leaf tea and how it toned your uterus and eased labor pains, but I wasn't sure if it would work or not. I ordered this when I was seven months pregnant and drank 3 bags of it iced every night. I was planning on having a natural birth with no pain relief, and wanted to do anything that would help. When my contractions started I didn't even know I was in labor. The contractions felt like very strong menstrual cramps and were not near as bad as I had anticipated. I was in labor 8 hours and pushed for about 30 minutes. My labor pains were mild and I was able to sit and let my body relax through the contractions. I can't be sure that this tea is a miracle tea because it was my first baby, but I would recommend it to any pregnant woman. I was able to have a wonderful birth without any numbing drugs, which was a very empowering experience.",3240

You don't need complicated electronic circuits for controls for Low, Medium & High to turn on and off simple appliances like this. More parts to go bad. So far this does the job really well - time will tell if it has just one crappy component made in China that was made poorly and will make our pad an early candidate for the landfill.

Youngblood Loose Mineral Foundation,0/0,5.0,"This mineral makeup is, by far, THE best on the market. The coverage is exceptional. The first time I came across it was at my hair salon. My young stylist used it, and she was living proof. Her skin and makeup always looked flawless, so I decided to give it a try. Being 'older', I was a bit reluctant, thinking it would make my skin look dry. Not at all. It covered up all my imperfections without having a caked on look. It's like magic. Any pigmentation, freckles, unevenness in tone, all vanish with Youngblood. It works exceptionally well at covering up ACNE so much so that my SON used to ask me to apply it to his face before he went off to school. I once went in to my local spa, walked over to the makeup counter to see if they had any of this type, and they didn't. When the woman at the desk asked if I needed any help, I started to explain that I was looking for a certain type of mineral makeup that they didn't have, and how much I thought it was the best on the market, without giving her the brand name.She then said 'is it youngblood?&#34;.. I thought i'd die! I immediately responded by saying a big YES! She said, &#34;I know, but we don't sell it here&#34;.

"Yogi Green Tea Blueberry Slim Life, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",1/3,2.0,"This tea is odd. It has a deceptively fruity smell, but tastes like nothing with a vague hint of something mildly fruity. Labeling the tea a ""blueberry"" tea was pretty inaccurate, in my opinion. (There are much tastier and much more fragrant fruit teas available on the market!) If you let it oversteep, it gets bitter and acidic. Maybe I got a bad batch (of 6 boxes??), but every bag I had tasted like it was fairly old and maybe stale. I started getting in the habit of waiting for the tea to cool and gulping it back as fast as possible, because the taste bothered me so much.I also chose this tea because it says it gives you energy. Despite drinking multiple cups a day for a month, I felt absolutely no effect on my energy levels (compared to my normal drink choice of unflavored green tea from various brands). If you never drink any caffeine, maybe you'd feel an ""energy boosting"" effect, but that's unlikely if you're already a tea lover.I do not recommend this tea. The other Yogi teas I've tried are much higher quality.The only reason I gave my review two stars instead of one is because if anything, the teabags are high quality, as you would expect for such an expensive tea. (I've never had a bag fall apart--too bad I'm only drinking it because I hate throwing out tea!)",4605

BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,1/2,3.0,"There are a few design flaws in this dryer that aren't so annoying that I returned it, but are bad enough that I wouldn't buy it again.Firstly, the temperature and on/off switches are not raised at all so it's difficult to move them--especially when you are right out of the shower and have lotion and/or hair gel on your hands. I usually have to wrap my hand in a t-shirt to switch between hot and cool. Another thing that annoys me is that the handle vibrates when it's on. This is the first hair dryer I've bought that is any fancier than a $20 one from Target, so maybe all these higher powered ones do that--but the constant tingling when I dry my hair bugs me.The dryer has a ton of power, but I find that when I use the highest power setting, it just blows my hair around like crazy and gets it all tangled. I usually have to stop mid-dry to brush all the tangles out. And even though it's so powerful, I don't feel like my actual dry time is shortened.",8583

The horrifying whine made by any other dryer I have owned is a low frequency hum from this Baby(liss). Drying time is less than half of what it used to be. Sexy rubberized matte black finish is oh so appealing. Buy this one!",4813
"Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula, Cream Soap Bar with Vitamin E, 3.5 oz - 1 ea",0/0,3.0,"I found this soap pleasant but probably not worth the price. It does have a &#34;slimy&#34; texture, but I actually found it felt good. The odor is very similar to bitter chocolate--not unpleasant, but it may not be your cup of tea, and it tends to become unpleasant in areas of the body where sweat accumulates.",7318

Frederic Fekkai Advanced Full Blown Volume Conditioner,0/0,2.0,"I have fine, straight, long, smooth hair, and when I used this product with the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo, it left my hair feeling clumpy, sticky, and almost brittle. I used it once, and the entire day I felt like my hair was tangled, and when I'd run my hands through it, my hair felt sticky. (And yes, I rinsed well; I have fine hair and make it a point to rinse well every day.) I wouldn't recommend this product to someone with a similar hair type.",3944
Singer Knitting Machine,1/1,4.0,"Wow! So many bad reviews.I haven't read them all, but the ones I've read made me think.I purchased this exact machine at Walmart for $15 on clearance (got 3 of 'em).I'm a guy and I don't knit, crochet or anything like that.I purchased it to help my daughter increase her production of things that she sells on line.So I bought it with the mindset that I would have to take some time and really try to get this thing to work consistently so I could show her how I set it up and was productive with it.I didn't really read the instructions and I couldn't figure out how the tensioner really worked so I improvised. Had some problems starting out.Turned out to be tension problems.Every problem I've had with this machine is related to tension.You MUST MUST MUST use enough tension for the yarn you are using, but not too much to jam the machine.The instructions seem to a$$ backwards.Not enough tension seems to be causing all the problems they listed.If the needle is splitting the yarn, you don't have enough tension.If you are getting bunches of yarn stuck on a needle or needles, you don't have enough tension.If, when a needle is rising, there is thread on the top of the needle and making it difficult to turn the knob or jamming, you don't have enough tension.If you have so much tension that it's hard to turn the wheel and you are still having problems, you can't use that yarn in this machine.When I first got the machine, I tried the pink and blue eyelash yarn that comes with the machine. What a mess that was.It took me forever to get the yarn off the needles and to pull it all out again.So, I messed with some other yarn (Red heart and some other value yarn from Walmart) and took my time carefully watching what was happening with the needles.This is when I finally figured out how important the tension was.I pulled all the yarn from the ball or skein and put it in a box on the floor, draped the yarn around my back and over my shoulder and through one of the holes in the tensioner and then kept tension on the line by pulling the loose end through the machine and holding it with one hand and turning the crank with the other and leaning forward or backward to keep it tight.I made sure I had two full lines before I went into automatic.So, start slow and make sure your tension is pretty tight.The tension did make the crank a bit hard to turn, but it didn't protest like when it jams.With the proper tension, you can go as fast as you want and I have.Remember the eyelash yarn I talked about. What mess it was? After I got the tension figured out, it actually ran better than regular yarn it looks fantastic.The only problem I see is that it takes some effort cranking this thing and even when everything is working perfectly it will still drop a stitch every once in a while.Now with all this said, I'm only making tubes, flat pieces seem to much more difficult and I haven't tried using the tensioner the way it was designed, but I will be attempting that soon.",8371

It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I have not had any trouble fitting my lunches into it even with my unusual sized Tupperware. I don't see much purpose to the zipper bottom &#34;secret&#34; utility belt compartment and think it would have been better if that extra two inches was just extended to the main compartment, especially because it can make the bag rather soft at the bottom and want to tip over a bit.

Calbee Snack Salad Snapea Crisps,0/0,4.0,"I could eat a whole bag of these in one sitting. They are an awesome snack! However, after recently being diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (and learning that it is very important to watch my intake of potassium, phosphorus and salt), I corresponded directly with the manufacturer. I learned that the Crisps are very high in potassium, which is not something allowed on my new kidney diet. I always thought that the FDA required food manufacturers define ALL of the nutritional facts on the label. Potassium is not listed. There are 760 mg of potassium in one serving (which is about 1/3 of the bag). I am disappointed I will have to stop eating the Snapea Crisps.",9412

Melissa & Doug Deluxe Jumbo Cardboard Blocks (40 pc),0/0,4.0,"We bought this for our little girl who loves to build things with wood blocks. This set of cardboard blocks was just thing to take it to the next (bigger) level and she loves them. The blocks were easy to put them together (though a bit time consuming) and while they don't stand up to being stepped on (it is cardboard after all) they seem very sturdy and they stay in brick shape.My only issue is that there are a lot more of the small, yellow bricks than there are of the big red ones or medium blue ones. The small yellow ones are just a bit bigger than a box of butter while the red ones are shoe box size. Would be nice to have equal amounts of each.Hope you find this helpful!",2505

Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,"Zoya's Daul has really received a bad rap in the beauty blogsphere because of the color and opaqueness (they argue it's too sheer), but I never had any issues with this product. It's not a one-coater; I usually need two good coats to make it fully opaque. And I absolutely disagree that Daul isn't a good color--I think it's extremely beautiful. It's a light purple shade with flecks of gold, which shimmers in the light and make your nails looks metallic. Oh so pretty.This nail polish dries pretty fast and lasts for a long time, especially if you use a top coat. I'm currently wearing it on my nails and it's been on for a week with no chipping.As for dupes, there are plenty, but none less expensive. I know Julep recently released one, but it's more expensive.So overall...love! :)",3478
"Soft 'N Style 3"" Jumbo Bronze Hair Pin 1 Lb Box",0/0,5.0,I bought these pins for my daughter who is a professional dancer. She wears a bun every day of her life and she loves these pins!

Not only does it taste great, but it also helps with those sugar spikes I tend to get throughout the day, especially right after eating. I am not a diabetic but I used to get hungry right after I ate and I got those ravaging hunger pangs with irritability and even lightheadedness. When I use this honey I don't get those anymore.I take honey water along with me during my outings in the summer. Not so great in the winter because it solidifies as it cools, becomes grainy/sandy and tickles my throat in an uncomfortable way as it goes down.

While he sleeps well through the night, he's never been able to nap well on his own. A friend mentioned that she used the Moby Wrap for her children's naps. We decided to try it out, and got somewhat mixed results in the beginning.After getting a bit more experience with the wrap, we found that the most important thing was to make sure his legs were properly and comfortably folded underneath his bottom. Secondly, we've found that keeping the wrap looser works better for him to nap easily. I used to try make it as snug as possible, but found that this makes it very difficult to keep his body straight (which makes me have to keep my body in a weird position).Overall, this is probably one of the best purchases we've made for our little boy.",8072

Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I have a 6 month old pit bull / lab mix and he's famous for tearing up toys & eating noses, eyes, etc. As soon as I received this it became his instant favorite. It isn't a challenge for him to get the squirrels out anymore - he just shakes the tree until they all go flying out. It's bigger than I thought it would be (which is wonderful). The squirrels fit just right and his mouth so he can squeak them fast and furiously. The squirrels have stitched eyes and noses so I don't have to worry about him swallowing any eyes. He loves to just play with the tree and we have ferocious tug of war matches. After over a week so far so good...except one of the squirrels split at the head but that was my fault for playing tug of war with it & him. The tree is a lot more durable for that. As always I'd recommend supervision with this toy because I'm not sure how long it would really last if he had some time to try and destroy it.

OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack,0/0,3.0,"I wanted to try another brand of wipes, and I'm not 100% pleased with these. I'll admit, I was lured by the price (I bought them on another site for a better price than Amazon). They are very thin and shrink considerably during the first laundering. They tend to stick to the diaper pieces in the dryer and don't spread out/open easily once placed in the diaper wipe solution and wrung out. I wind up trying to use two hands, but anyone with small children knows that won't work. So, I wind up trying to shake the wipe open with one hand - and I get drips of solution everywhere. On the positive side, they are soft, and do the job. I haven't owned them long enough to figure out if they fray or not. Once they do, I'll probably toss them. Personally, I prefer something thicker and our favorite brand is GroVia. They are a little more expensive, but time and efficiency are precious commodities!I won't buy these again and I wouldn't recommend them.",3142

Natural Calm Natural Vitality,1/1,5.0,My son has a chronic colon condition. After regular laxatives failed to help and after finding out and experiencing the horrific side effects of certain ingredients we took him off all laxatives. We heard about Natural Calm and tried it...it is the only product that has helped him! I have 4 kids and he is the only one who takes this and we have noticed that he is the only one who does not get sick during the winter like everyone else! His immune system has been greatly helped by this product! We are so thankful we found Natural Calm!!,7831

Cholula Original Mexican Hot Sauce with Wooden Stopper Top - 12 oz,0/0,4.0,"""Hey, just because this is a highly recognized, readily available brand doesn't mean it doesn't deliver the goods"" according to Scott Roberts. Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.On my own, I've been taste testing hot sauces, unaware of Roberts or an entire movement of ""chili-heads"". I've purchased about 40 hot sauces and began taste testing them - day after day - week after week - writing up notes. (Everyone needs a hobby)What I found is Cholula is one of the best and it is near the top. BTW",1787
"LEGO Green Building Plate (10"" x 10"")",0/1,2.0,"I read the reviews and decided to buy anyway, but these things really are flimsy. It's a shame no one carries the old, stiffer kind. Definitely measure the size, it looks smaller than you would think.",3193
Alex fashion weave loom with fluffy yarn ages 7+,3/3,4.0,The brand of the weave loom I purchase is different but the contents is exactly the same. Rainbow color yarn balls and the wooden loom. I purchase it bcuz I am always looking to expand my crafting skills and enjoy trying new things. With winter around the corner I wanted to learn different ways of making a scarf for Christmas gifting besides knitting and crochet. So I bought this wooden loom. I must admit it's a bit pricey but sorta worth it. The instructions aren't very detailed but YouTube has loom weaving vids that help make instructions alot more clearer to understand. I had to knock one star off bcuz of that and the fact that the box states 75 yards of yarn but really it's only good for making one scarf. Good thing I have a large stock of yarn and also it's kinda difficult to make a scarf bcuz the length of your woven item is short so the way you make a scarf is to weave up to the top of the loom then sew several pieces together to make it into a scarf length. It's really tedious and this loom is probably best only to make potholders or small pouches but not scarves or anything of that sort. Overall I think it's an okay gift to purchase but keep in mind if the gift receiver doesn't have much patience or unable to sit for long periods this may not be the best gift as it's very time consuming and requires lots of patience sitting on your caboose.*EDIT,1596

"Charlee Bear Dog Treat, 16-Ounce, Liver",0/0,5.0,"Our dog loves these. Perhaps my favorite part about them is that unlike other dog treats, they are dry so you can put a few in your pocket while you go on a walk and not have to worry about stinking up your hands or pocket. That said, they aren't appealing enough to my dog to distract him from squirrels or other smells when we're on a walk!",9555

Rescue Remedy (20ml vial),1/1,5.0,"I am a fan of Bach Flowers remedies. I have used the Rescue Remedy for two years now and the Hormina (a Brazilian formulation) for three years. When I know that I am getting edgy, I warn my family, take some Rescue Remedy, and within a few hours I am feeling back to normal. Some people have reviewed it and said it did not work for them, but it works for me. Don't believe the comments about it being the cereal alcohol either. There is not enough cereal alcohol in 5-8 drops to be of ANY significance in evaluating this product. Hope you have the same benefit that I did. I love it because it is natural. I lived in Brazil for four years and Bach Flowers are used a great deal by many people. They even have whole pharmacies dedicated to these remedies. Brazilians are very health conscious and want to stay away from chemicals as much as possible.",9149

HALO Newborn Micro-Fleece Sleepsack Swaddle,1/1,5.0,While we have received a HALO SleepSack for review we've also bought several of our own in cotton and fleece. They are hands down the safest way to ensure baby is warm enough at bed without putting them at risk with blankets. I find them easy to put on and take off of baby and having the zipper open from the bottom makes diaper changes in the night quick and easy. We used these for my daughter and now I'm getting more for our new baby boy who will be joining us in a few months. I highly recommend HALO SleepSacks!,1387
Bye Bye Blemish Dry Lotion Drying 1 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I have some what of an acne problem. They are not actually acnes but little bumps that sometimes turn into acne or otherwise sink back down. But during the last couple of months they would not go away so I would tend to scratch it off which is a really bad habit. I read a review of this product on another site and I thought why not. It's pretty strong so it sometimes burns your eyes and dries your skin but it does the job. It got rid of my bumps in no joke 4 days. There are still abit left but I'm going to leave my skin for a couple of days since my skins reallly dry now. I really recommend it, I'm really surprised it works.",6290

BD DigitalThermometer,0/0,3.0,Ordered this thermometer thinking it would beep and let me know if my kids had it in the right position when I was taking their temps. However the beeping must only be a feature on the basal thermometers because this thermometer does NOT beep. I could have gone to the local drugstore and got a digital thermometer that does the same thing for cheaper.,7201
Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,I was happy I guessed right on the size as fitting is crucial. The DVD was very helpful in fitting and handling the dog with this new collar and technique. My dog is a Doberman puppy- but a huge puppy and she pulls during our entire walk. The collar has definitely helped and I am enjoying our walks far more. I have her staying by my side most of the time and she only trips me a few times per walk- so this is definitely progress.

Honestly I did get a couple tiny blemishes because it is thick but I almost feel like it's that or deal with dry skin. I just use some spots of blemish cream hoping I will get used to it and if I had to, I would limit it to areas outside tzone which don't tend to break out vs stop using it. You can use it anywhere but I prefer the face. The smell and consistency reminds me of Vicks Vapor rub. I prefer an herbal vs perfume smell to products and it works so it doesn't bother me. Perfect for winter.",7759

Used kitty litter gets into the run that holds the screen in place and creates a clumpy mess that has to be washed in order to get the clump out of the crease, I give the product a 1/2 out of 5 points, and the half is for effort. Thanks anyway. I would return the kitty box for credit but while I was putting the self cleaning box together one of the cats urinated in the cardboard box and made it unuseable.

Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething.

Lady-Comp Fertility Monitor - Fahrenheit,1/1,5.0,"I have been using the Lady Comp for almost a year now. Before getting married, I had already decided against any kind of unnatural form of BC. So I did some research and found the Lady Comp. I bought it a few months before getting married so that it would have a few months to learn my cycle. It make natural family planning so much easier. I don't think I would last very long having to chart my own basal body temperature every morning. The Lady Comp does all the thinking for me. I would recommend the Lady Comp to anyone.",3608

If I had been able to to tolerate the saltiness long enough, perhaps there would have been spiciness. I can't overstate just how salty and gross these were. Perhaps the mango beneath was tasty -- I cannot attest to that. I believe another reviewer mentioned &#34;taming&#34; these down by wiping off some of the coating. I can't imagine how one would approach that task, as it really is very well-adhered. If anyone can suggest a better brand, I'd love to know of it -- this combo sounds like it could be wonderful if handled right.",8622

Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat,1/1,3.0,"I have both the Cooshee booster and this one and I have to say I like the Cooshee better. They're both good - they do the job of boostering the kid closer to their food, but the Cooshee has a smooth surface that was easy to clean. The Lionheart has a texture on the seat part (where food is most likely to be dropped) that has never come completely clean for me. I've used a scrub brush and BonAmi, but it still looks discolored. The Cooshee I can just wipe off with a rag and everything comes off. This is my only complaint with the Lionheart chair.My first child used the Cooshee and now my second child is using it.

Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,0/0,5.0,I have five cats but made a mistake...I only ordered one of these for them for Christmas! One of my cats has claimed this as her own so looks like I'll be buying four more. She plays until she literally starts panting! It's the best toy I've ever bought them and there have been quite a few toys it has beaten.I have found it very helpful to store the toy in the box it came in as then the cats can chew on neither the feathers or the pole when we aren't playing with it.,6268

Worlds Freshest Spray Millet 5 Pound Box Nemeth Farms the Original,0/0,5.0,"I agree with others that shipping the sprays in a plastic bag within the box would be terrific. That said, my sprays were huge, 2-3 inches longer than my store-bought brand from Petco. They were fresh and had long stems that can be tied together with a rubberband and hung from the top of the cage. My birds luv millet, but they really went after this light-golden variety. The sprays are very clean. I highly recommend this product.",55
Angel By Thierry Mugler For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray Refillable 3.4 oz,3/3,5.0,"A lovely scent that is soft, angelic, and somewhat mysterious. It lasts a long time, and I can usually still smell it faintly the next day. My husband, who rarely comments on perfume, loved this one on me. If you are buying the large 3.4 ounce refillable bottle, it comes in a lovely tall bottle called Rising Star. If you want the star-shaped bottle, (Shooting Star), go with the smaller 1.7 ounce bottle. Whatever bottle you choose, this perfume is beautiful!",4092
LEGO Ultimate Building Set - 405 Pieces (6166),0/1,5.0,"We like buying LEGO for our kids. They have lots of fun building all kinds of different things. This is a basic starting LEGO set for 4 years + with very high quality. The LEGO pieces are colorful and sturdy, will not fall apart easily. This is quite important as kids at this age (4+) easily get frustrated when their work falls apart. 405 pieces are a lot although we will definitely buy much more later. I believe this LEGO set is a good choice and I also buy it as gifts. The price is reasonable too.",1079
Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,"Zoya's Daul has really received a bad rap in the beauty blogsphere because of the color and opaqueness (they argue it's too sheer), but I never had any issues with this product. It's not a one-coater; I usually need two good coats to make it fully opaque. And I absolutely disagree that Daul isn't a good color--I think it's extremely beautiful. It's a light purple shade with flecks of gold, which shimmers in the light and make your nails looks metallic. Oh so pretty.This nail polish dries pretty fast and lasts for a long time, especially if you use a top coat. I'm currently wearing it on my nails and it's been on for a week with no chipping.As for dupes, there are plenty, but none less expensive. I know Julep recently released one, but it's more expensive.So overall...love! :)",3469

However, they get dirty quick (or maybe my kids are the only messy eaters) so they get washed about once a week (maybe a little less).

Williams Williams Mug Shaving Soap,0/1,1.0,"Been wet shaving about a year now and like it. I have been using Col Conk but ran out and picked this up cheap at the local CVS. Again, I find that you get what you pay for in life and this was lousy but cheap. Work hard to lather and it will dry up before you can pick up your razor and go to it. Only good thing is there is no soap ring around the sink, since the lather will evaporate. It sizzles like alka-selzer in a glass of water! I will stick to Col Conk, might try Van der Hagen since it gets good reviews on here. I really didn't mind the smell and never got any comments from the wife or kids on that, so I can't say that it smells bad. That's my advice.",1762
Tyrosine 500 mg capsules,2/2,2.0,"Starting taking just a few days ago. A few hours after taking one capsule I felt a knot in my stomach. I'd read reviews about possible upset stomach and had hoped it would bypass me. Nope. So I started to dig a little deeper into metabolism of l-tyrosine only to discover that it is not water soluble. I did a little test and opened a capsule in (warm) water. The powder actually floated on top the water and a film appeared over the surface of the water as well. I stirred the mixture up and it would not dissolve. So - back to research. L-tyrosine does not dissolve in the stomach and is excreted in urine - so how in the world is this stuff supposed to be absorbed in the body? I'm not sure if I am experiencing a placebo effect with these. I cannot stand the ache in my stomach. I take on empty stomach as instructed, eat a meal, feel fine for a few hours but then when hunger pangs start so does the awful ache. Granted the stomach is filled with hydrochloric acid, yet I envision a clump of white powder settled in the pit of my stomach. Hopefully I can get through the bottle. Does anyone have a remedy? Next I'll try n-acetyl-l-tyrosine - supposed to metabolize better. The only reason this is getting an extra star is simply for packaging and speed of delivery.",6676

Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,3.0,"For years my family has been using an old broken tv from the 80s which doesn't produce tv images but produces a static sound that's very soothing and blocks out noise from the outside. It's begun to malfunction. The last time we unplugged it, it was very hard to get it to come back on. It finally did, but I think it may be on its last legs. We turn up the volume fairly loud to block out noises from outside. I'm looking to replace this. The Dohm got better reviews than any other product. I love the sound it makes. It's a very soothing, clean sound of whooshing air running through the machine. It looks durable and it doesn't have any distracting lights that would interfere with sleeping. However it just can't compete with the old tv as far as volume goes. You can adjust the volume somewhat, but even at its highest setting, it's just not as loud as even a fan is. People talk about its sound ""filling a room"". Maybe a tiny closet? I don't think I could even hear it at its highest setting if I was on the other side of the bedroom from it. I think the only way this is going to replace the old tv is if we got 3 or 4 of them and maybe their combined volume would be enough? So I'm disapointed with the volume of it very much because it's way too quiet. I don't see how this could block out the noise of a dog barking outside, sirens, etc. at all because of the low volume. The sound itself is very nice though. I think it would be good for an office or if you were travelling.",3887

"Just for Men Brush-In Color Gel for Mustache, Beard & Sideburns, Sandy Blond, 1 color gel, (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,"I have used Sandy Blond on my head hair for ~ 5 years. At first I used the hair coloring but it was messy and I wasted a whole bottle just trying to fix sideburns and hair at the temple. Also, if you only have graying in a few spots, the hair coloring will make the rest of your hair darker which really doesn't fix anything and makes it noticable. I found that the beard coloring works perfect on head hair also and it is much easier to target only the areas you need to fix. You can also get multiple applications out of a kit. Just make sure to squeeze all the air out of the tubes before putting the caps on or it can degrade.Now, 5 years later, that my gray extends over the ears also, I still use the beard coloring. Once you brush it on, it works best if you take the brush and pull some of the coloring out onto the head to blend it together. If you experiment with the time left in hair by starting at 5 minutes and working up in 1/2 minute increments, you will eventually find where the color is correct. That combined with the blending will make this product work very well. BTW- 5 minutes doesn't hardly change the hair but for me but 6 - 7 minutes works. You should use a stop watch to get consistent results.",663

Perio Therapy Gum Care Gel Toothpaste - 3.5 Oz,1/1,5.0,"No place in my town sells this product. I took a chance on it when I saw it on amazon and I am glad I did. I have used many kinds of both herbal and regular toothpaste and mouthwashes over the years but none were able to stop a raging gum infection I had picked up from somewhere after many years of being told by dentists my mouth was very healthy. This is more expensive than other toothpastes but it is the only one I will use from now on as it is the only one that seems to be able to keep the bad bacteria at bay. I use it with the companion mouthwash of the same name.I recommend this toothpaste and the mouthwash intended to be used with it to anyone. The mouthwash, to some people, has a funny taste, but that is just because it is hydrogen peroxide based and that is what you taste.If you buy it as a set (they sell it this way on amazon and you can find it if you look), you get a free mouthpiece so you can use the toothpaste as a tooth whitener, too.",87

Cake Eyeliner from Fran Wilson,0/0,4.0,"but easier for me to purchase via Amazon Prime for about a dollar or 2 more than I was buying my La Femme cake liner for(NOT the creamy cake liner, just the regular stuff, the creamy is awful)...but it'll be here in 2 days rather than a week or more shipping for the La Femme.This is pigmented, so if you love a DARK and INTENSE liner go ahead and try this. I don't notice any smudging, which is the wonderful thing about a good cake liner, if you apply it wet over some sort of primer or powdered base, then let it dry, maybe add a little sealant (or a spray of mac fix+, urban decay or skindinavia setting sprays, whatever your fancy)it's going to stay quite well for you.You can take this BOLD-which I prefer with a nice 60's flick at the edge-or you can take this natural, or smudgy...all depending on how much water you add, the brush you use.The la femme pots used nearly daily last me around 8 months or more I'd say...I'm assuming the Franny Wilson liner will be about the same.I did notice some strange slight silver sparkle when I held the liner up to the light..but I don't see it on my eye at ALL, so I don't really care.I'm happy so far...will update if my opinion changes.",8337

Dr. Scholl's Foot Cream Ultra Overnight For Her 3.5 oz. Tube,0/0,5.0,"So, I had abused my heels with wearing flip flops, going barefoot around the house and we used to have Berber carpeting, so I think the constant scratching of the abrasive Berber didn't do my feet any favors. I had tried everything. I also hate wearing socks and shoes and don't want to wear socks at night either. I had dry heels and cracks were appearing everywhere on both feet. I tried a pumice stone and typical lotions, without any results. I was concerned enough to not want to have it continue, otherwise I'd need an appointment with a podiatrist.I had read that urea was helpful for dry, rough heels and this product contains urea, amongst others. I used this product morning after my shower after drying my feet well. Then at night, hit or miss, before bedtime as well. It took about 3 weeks of use, but now my heels look fantastic and healthy. All the dryness is gone! The cracks are almost all totally healed as well.I used the Mr Pumice (purple bar) gently under running water with gentle cleanser, then dried my feet well and applied the Dr. Scholls to my heels. Voila!I'll never be without this product again. Give it time. I'm sure if you do the nighttime routine w/socks, it may work faster for you.One cannot afford to get infections, so by keeping your heels healthy, it equates to overall health and might save you a trip to the doc.",181

So, we put this, the original, on our registry. The company that fulfilled the order is called Babyhaven. They sent us the deluxe, which is not what we ordered. We sent them a screenshot proving to them that what we ordered on our registry was the original, so they agreed to refund the person who purchased it for us the money, but said that we have to pay shipping. That seemed ridiculous, since it is their fault for advertising that they're selling the original but sending out the crappy deluxe. We eventually worked it out with Amazon, getting some Amazon credits in exchange for having to pay shipping to BabyHaven, but only after some phone calls and big hassle. So",214

San Juan,0/0,4.0,"This game can be really fun. It is not as easy to get into as Dominion because a player needs to be fairly familar with all the cards in the deck so that appropriate stategies and decisions can be made.Play can vary greatly depending on how many people are playing. If 2 people are playing then the Library is a must build if you get it. And then if you get a Quarry... gg. On the other hand, if you can get Library, Smithy, Guild Hall then that is gg. If neither player gets either of those combos then you can have some fun games. With 3 to 4 players, the Library becomes less effective.For the price, I think this is a good game if you like playing games like Dominion, etc. The set up time is about 2 minutes and a 2-player game can be over in about 15-20mins which is a great advantage over games like Puerto Rico and Power Grid if you are short on time.The level of strategy versus luck in this game is definitely tilted in the favor of luck (unlike the above mentioned games). This can be frustrating at times if you are a big strategist but also allows those that are more casual gamers to feel superior to the hardcore gamer that gets some bad draws.All in all, this is a good game with a 3-4 game learning curve (to really know all the cards) but that can be done in less than one hour.",272
Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Baby Sling,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love this product. So convenient for quick outings since my son refuses to sit in his car seat. I can run my errands just like I used to with no problems. My baby usually falls right asleep when I place him in this sling. I was initially skeptical due to the price, but I'm so glad I bought this! We use our ergo for longer trips, but this is the perfect addition to our baby gear.",3185
Quercetti 45-Piece Transparent Marble Run - Marble Run Construction Toy,0/0,1.0,"Seriously, this marble run is dollar store quality. Cheap, light weight plastic... even the slighted nudge knocks the pieces out of place. Some of the pieces just sit on top of one another, rather than ""snap"" together like they should.And unlike the description and the picture on the front of the box, this set does not come with real glass marbles. You get 10 plastic balls that are about half the size of a real marble. They still work of course, but just the fact that they show real marbles being used adds insult to injury.Not to mention, 45 pieces isn't enough to get creative with. I'd recommend spending slightly more money of a better quality version with more pieces.",7507
Softheat Softheat Heating Pad Moist Or Dry King Size,0/0,4.0,"I had ordered a different brand, but this is simular. Not a soft as the one I had. It shuts off after about an hour which is perfect. very happy with it.",7076
Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C,1/1,5.0,We have been using this product since my husbands heart surgery. we have not had a serious cold in two years. THANK YOU,9065
Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,"This was wider than I realized, so I should have measured it before ordering. But my 5 year old lab Stella (60 lbs.) loves it! So we're keeping it. One size smaller would have probably worked. But the large size is big enough where Stella's bed fits on top and she is not laying on top of the perimeter support bars.Good purchase. Very sturdy. Does not move on the floor when Stella jumps on and off of it. Top canvas/fabric part is very strong and sags only slightly when Stella is on top of it, so Stella seems to feel secure and comfortable laying on top of it.Color is darker than it appears in the picture -- it's more of a medium to dark green color in most lighting. Only in very bright lighting, it resembles the blue/green pictured on Amazon.",5390
Howdy Doody Ventriloquist Doll,0/0,1.0,"This doll was advertised as in good condition when in fact it was in poor condition. My lesson, just because it's cheaper doesn't mean it's worth it",314
"PowerBar Performance The Original Energy Bar, 2.29-Ounce Bars",0/0,2.0,"These bars were tasty but they were also 'sticky'. It was sometimes difficult to get the wrapper off, and when I could get it off they would stick to my fingers",2372

Ponaris Ponaris Nasal Emollient,0/0,5.0,A while back I suffered from frequent nosebleeds. I was treated by an ENT doctor with several cauterizations. She also wanted me to keep my nostrils moist at night. She suggested Ponaris. Well it helped me heal and I have used it every night since and have had no further problems with nosebleeds.Bottom line; doctor recomended and effective!,5849

Hidden Kingdom Insects,0/0,2.0,The description made this seem like it would be outstanding and biologically correct. It is not. Over priced. I could get the same thing for cheaper at any toy store or box store.,276

Protein Energizer (Rice Protein),0/0,4.0,I really like the taste of this protein powder; the only negative I have is the package. Since it comes in a small package everytime you put your hand in to scoop out the powder it makes a mess all over the counter; which is also wasting product. The product is good but if maybe it was in a canister there would not be so much waste and mess. This is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars; the protein powder is too expensive to waste.,8540

Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,1/1,4.0,"I purchased one each for my 9 year old son and 5 year old daughter for road trips. I was worried they would not hold the weight of heavier items like laptops but they do. They work great for watching DVDs, iPads, playing on the laptop plus eating and coloring in. My kids love them.",3377
MILITARY ENERGY GUM - Military Caffeine Energy Gum - CINNAMON - TRAY (24 packs 5pc) - 100mg Caffeine per piece,0/0,3.0,The gum gives you a pep but the taste isn't so good. The gum has a cinnamon taste but a strong after taste.,1474
"Safari Cat Shedding Comb, Wood Handle",0/0,5.0,For getting mats out of your cat's coat you can't beat this tool. I have used it in my cat grooming business for over twenty years and I wouldn't recommend anything else but this comb. All the fancier tools out there just don't do the job this simply comb does for getting out all the dead hair and tugging off the mats. My customers have used this as well and won't go to anything else.,9209
